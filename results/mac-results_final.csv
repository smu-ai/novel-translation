次日天未明时，刘老老便起来梳洗了， 又将板儿教了几句话； 五六岁的孩子，听见带了他进城逛去，喜欢的无不应承。,"Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn. As soon as she had washed and done her hair, she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great house – an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city.","The next morning, Liu Geo woke up at five o'clock in the morning, as he got dressed again. He taught him some more words; children who heard of him coming to town were always ready to accept his advice.","But not before noon did Grannie Liu rise up and get herself out of bed again, after a little self-consciousness as to whether she should go off on her own again; and taking with her the instruction to take应收与太监平儿，来作见她大舅妈王琦瑶，王琦瑶颇多配合，还是一脸不高兴。","At dawn the next day, Liu Langlang got up early and washed his face. He taught him a few words as well. Five or six-year-olds like to go with their parents to visit places of interest.","She got up about dawn with a purpose already etched on her face. She had just seen her 'old friend' that morning and wanted to spend the day shopping; so she rose early, put on a dressing-gown, and began to prepare for their journey. There was to be a boy of five years with them that day: he was to be carried in a cradle and to behave himself very adequately or his mother would receive a severe retribution.","The next morning, before dawn, Old Liu rose to dress and clean herself, then taught Baoer a few words; a five-or-six-year-old child, hearing that he would be taken into the city for a stroll, readily agreed without hesitation.","First thing next morning Grannie Liu rose early, washed and combed herself, and drilled Ban-er with a few phrases to say. A child of five was thrilled by the prospect of going into the city with her.","The next day, when the sun had not yet risen, Liu Lao got up, washed himself, and then gave some instructions to his son. The five or six-year-old children who heard him going to the city were all eager to accompany him.","Grannie Liu got up before daylight was even visible in the sky and, after washing and brushing her teeth, took little Ban-er round to Grannie Li's for a few words before she went off on her expedition to the capital with the party from the manor house.","The next morning, before the dawn had fully broken, Old Liu rose to dress and groom herself, and then she instructed Bao'er with a few words; a five or six-year-old child would be delighted at the prospect of being taken into the city to wander about, and readily agreed to do as she wished.","Before dawn next morning, Granny Liu got up to wash and tidy herself up, and she also drilled a few phrases into her grandson. A child of five or six will agree to anything if you tell him he is going to be taken into town.","First thing in the morning Grannie Liu rose to attend to her toilette, then trained Ban-er to say a few words of greeting. Hearing that he would be going into the city with her in the afternoon, the little boy was beside himself with delight and willingly submitted himself to the recitations.","The next day, when it was still dark, Liu Lao Lao got up, combed and washed himself, and also taught a few words to the board.

钱老板道：“是，是，多谢香主。” 在一张椅上坐了，续道：“属下将小郡主藏在猪肚里带进宫来，一来是为瞒过宫门侍卫的重重搜检，二来是要瞒过沐王府众人的耳目。,"'Thank you, Master,' said Butcher Qian, seating himself in one of the chairs and continuing. 'There were really two reasons why I hid the Little Countessinside this pig's carcass. One was to get her past the Palace Guard: they always search everyone at the gate. But it was also to get her past any of the Mu Family spies who might be out watching for us.","Money Master said, 'Yes, yes, thank you for your hospitality.' He sat on a chair and continued, ""The subordinate has concealed his little sister in a pig's belly and brought her into the palace. One reason is that he needs to deceive the guards of the court. Another reason is that he needs to deceive the eyes of the people in the Muxi Family.""","If you like,' said Butcher Qian sitting at a table on the other side of the door showed his guest a sympathetic way. 'you can imagine how grateful he was to the Master for giving him such an opportunity. He has been trying for some time to hide this little gem in the pig's belly inside the palace gate. It is two things: it will help to prevent the eunuch from searching them through the gates while they are going; and it will help to trick the Mu family into knowing what is going on.","Mr. Qian said, ""Yes, yes, thank you very much."" He sat down on a chair and continued, ""The subordinate took the princess to the pig's stomach and brought her inside the palace. One reason is to avoid being searched by the guards of the imperial palace; another is to avoid the ears of the沐 family.""","Of course,' said Butcher Qian gratefully. 'Thank you, Master. Now... how shall I say this? I brought her here the way we usually carry weapons to the Palace: by hiding her in one of the carcasses. That's to avoid checking the inside of the carcass; and mainly to avoid checking the cages where the Monarchs' enemies are kept.","Money Master said, ""Yes, yes, thank you for your concern, Chief Incense."" He then sat on a chair and continued, ""Subordinate hid the princess in the pig's stomach to bring her into the palace. The reason was twofold: firstly, to deceive the guards' thorough inspections at the palace gates, and secondly, to avoid suspicion from everyone in the Mu王府.""","Yes, Goong-goong, ' said Butcher Qian, and sat himself down. 'I stuffed her inside a pig's belly to get past the gate. That was for the guards at the gate; but I also needed to fool the people at the Mu Family's inn.","The boss said, ""Yes, thank you, Master.

'I carried her in my pig's belly to get her past the guards at the Palace gate and the Mu people at the Mu Warehouse.","Mr. Qian said, ""Yes, yes, thank you for your concern."" He sat down on a chair and continued, ""Subordinate hid the princess in the pig's stomach when bringing her into the palace.

He sat down on a chair and continued, ""This subordinate hid the little princess in a pig’s stomach to bring her into the palace. Firstly, it was to evade the repeated searches by the palace guards, and secondly, it was to keep it hidden from the eyes and ears of everyone at the沐王府Muhu Temple mansion.""","Yes, Goong-goong, ' said Butcher Qian, sitting himself down at a table. 'I hid her in the pig's belly to fool the guards at the Palace gates and anyone else who might have been looking for her.","The boss said, ""Yes, yes, thank you, Madam. Sitting on a chair, he continued, ""I hid the young lady in a pig's belly and brought her into the palace to deceive the heavy scrutiny of the palace guards, and also to hide her from the eyes of the Mansion of Mansion King. ""","Many thanks, Master,' said Butcher Qian, and he sat himself down. 'I brought the Little Countess in here hidden inside a pig's belly to avoid the heavy search that would be made at the gate of the Palace; and to avoid the eyes of the Mu people, who might otherwise have seen her.'","Yes, yes, thank you, Master,' said Butcher Qian, and he sat down. 'Now about getting the Little Countess in,' he went on. 'I thought of hiding her in a pig's belly for two reasons. First, to get her past all those Palace guards without being searched; secondly, to stop anyone from the Mu Family finding out about her."

When they lost her, they would have great sorrow. They would cry day and night. Even though they were very worried about their health, they did not want to lose their daughter.","The father and daughter had now lived together almost all their lives; its loss would be to them a source of extreme sorrow. They were therefore at first unable to believe that the cat had really been taken; but when they came to realize that she was gone, it caused so much distress that they fell into protracted sickness. Before long Shi-yin, who already had a ill health, was also affected by his loss and sought medical advice and astrological consultation every day.","The husband and wife had only this daughter for half a century, and losing her was a source of unbearable distress.

They constantly sought doctors and consulted about the future.","The couple, who in half a lifetime had begotten but this one daughter, were now plunged in woe at her loss; they wept night and day, caring little for their own lives. As a month passed by, Shen Yin fell sick from anxiety, and Lady Feng was also laid low with a sickness brought on by her grief for her lost child. Day by day they sent for doctors and soothsayers.","The loss of their only child had driven the夫妇俩日夜号啕, so that each of them had now fallen ill, and the state of mourning had nearly broken up the two lives. By the end of a month, Shi-yin himself was suffering from the effects of忧伤, and his wife, Feng-shi, had become insane with grief for her little girl.","The text translates to:

The couple had only one daughter in half a lifetime, and losing her would cause immense distress. Therefore, they cried day and night, almost disregarding their lives. Looking at the situation after a month, the scholar had fallen ill first, and the madam also fell ill due to worrying about their daughter. Every day they consulted doctors and diviners.","This is the only child we have, so the loss of her has caused us the utmost distress. We have been waking and weeping all night long. In less than a month Shan-yin has already fallen ill and Cuvier has gone to the extremity of calling in the doctors and taking all kinds of medicine.","Shi-yin and his wife had had no other child but this daughter whom they now seemed destined to lose. The old couple mourned her day and night with a grief that knew no bounds; and by the end of a month Shi-yin was already ill, while Lady Feng, unable to bear the loss of her little girl, was also lying at death's door. Medical advice and astrological consultations were sought daily."

Until very recently, I was using that razor for medical discovery on people, and tired of making people feel this way.","How hideous things I've been exposing this ugliness with my literary scalpel all these years, now even expose it is a burden for me.","How vile! For half a life I've been using literature as a scalpel to uncover this ugliness, and now even the task of exposing it grows boring.","How vile things they are! For half my life, I have been using the scalpel of literature to expose this vile nature, but now even the act of exposing it bores me.","How repulsive! I spent the first half of my life using literature to expose such ugliness, and now even the act of exposure seems tedious.","How repulsive it is! I have always used literature as a scalpel to expose this ugliness, but now I am tired of even exposing it.","How I've detested that sort of ugliness during my entire life, and I've used my literary handsaw to dissect it.

虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother had already been married to him on the high wheat field of happiness in a solemn period of her life, I did not have any guilt or blame attached to me because my grandfather was indeed a father who was both a son-in-law and a grandson, having come from the family's clan and marriage at the time. The two of them were always together, but with their considerable differences in nature, they could not be ignored or neglected for long. Moreover, I do not recall that my father has fallen down the earth, so writing about it is still referring to him as ""Mr. Xue Qiao"".","Even though my grandma had gone through a harmonious marriage with my granddad, who was凤凰般的心地善良，但在那个充满痛苦又像幸福、庄严庄稼地里的庄严里，我奶奶已经染了历史的疤痕，事实上当年我们爷儿们还做过的事也被爷爷和两个孙子女当作邪事看成翻过了。而且我爸爸并没有出生，所以在这辈子我还是用'另个顾章'来统称比较好。","Though I have a grandmother who was harmonious with him at the cornfield, in that solemn process of pain and happiness, my grandmother still carried my sin and guilt half way, but she was after all the father of the North East Country of High Middletown, but then she was a single housewife who was married by right and fair in the middle of the night, while her husband and she were not always in harmony, there was also some degree of randomness, instability, and even though my father didn't fall on his face, so when it comes to writing about those times, I should still call him Yu Quanlao.","Although I had the corrupt ecstasy of falling in love with her in the sorghum field, I had the half-bitter, half-richer, ambiguous joy of having a child. However, Grandma, who had married a man from a wealthy family and was therefore carrying a child born to Father, was at once returning to her hometown on a marriage bed, and could not help being attracted by the licentious, accidental, unpredictable man who had fathered the child. By the time this story begins, however, Zhong Xiang-ao has already been publicly acknowledged as a man; so, for now, I continue to call him that way.","Although my grandmother and he were already engaging in a harmonious relationship amidst the millet field, in that solemn process that was half pain and half joy, and although my grandmother did conceive of my mixed legacy father, she was still the highly celebrated father figure of the Northeastern GaoMi region. But at that time, she was the officially married wife of Grandfather, and their union was always somewhat casual, accidental, and unstable. Moreover, my father had not yet been buried, so when writing about events up to that point, it is more accurate to refer to him as Yu Zhanao.","Even though Grandma had already lain with Daddy鳌 in the sorghum field, and although she was already carrying his child, she was still legally married to Shan Qiang, and their union, however painful it may have been for Grandma, was still only semi-h神圣. Moreover, Father hadn't yet been buried in the ground, so when it came to writing about those days, it was more accurate to call him Yu Zhan'ao.","Although my grandmother was married to my grandfather, who was a well-known figure in the village of Gaoliang, she was also impregnated by me. However, since my father had fallen out of favor, it was more accurate to call him ""Yuzhan"" (余占鳌). As for my grandmother, she was married off as a concubine and had a tumultuous relationship with my grandfather, who had a certain degree of freedom and instability in their relationship. Despite this, my grandmother was still considered to be a respectable woman in the village.","Even though Grandma had harmonized with the phoenix in Northeast Gaomi Township, having been married to a local boy, Granddad was still a man of means who could have had his pick of wives. Since he and Grandma were not well off, it was more accurate to call him Yu Zhan'ao.","Although my grandmother had already conceived my mixed legacy father, who was a symbol of the High密 Northeast Region's charm amidst a mix of pain and joy, the process of their union in the millet field was both sacred and tinged with sorrow and happiness. Despite this, my grandmother was still the lawfully married wife of Grandfather in the eyes of her family. Their marriage, however, was like a casual affair by the reeds and streams, full of unpredictability and instability. Moreover, my father hadn't yet been buried, so when recounting those times, referring to him as Yu Zhanao is more accurate.","Although my grandmother had already been harmoniously united with him in the sorghum fields, and although she was carrying my father—who would be both sinner and hero of our region—in her womb as a result of that solemn process that was half pain and half bliss, she was still the lawfully wedded wife of the Shan family at the time. My grandfather’s union with her was always destined to be a fleeting and illicit one, marked by a considerable degree of capriciousness, contingency, and instability. Moreover, since my father hadn’t even been born yet, it would be more accurate for me to refer to him as Yu Zhan’ao when recounting events from that period.","Even though Grandma had already made love to Yang Yisheng in the sorghum field and conceived my half-good-half-bad father, she was still the married wife of Shan Gengxue, and their union was at best a mixture of pain and pleasure – or was it joy? – imbued with a strong whiff of the fields of Sorghum and Willows. Granddad had yet to bury the body of his first wife, so it's probably as good to call him Yu Zhan'ao, at least until further notice.","Although my grandmother was already in harmony with him in the millet field, in that solemn process half of pain and half of happiness, my grandmother, although she bore some of my guilt, was still a refined father from a high-ranking family in northeastern China. However, my grandmother was a single woman who was officially married to my grandfather. My grandfather and she were more like a match made in heaven, with a certain degree of casualness, randomness, and instability. Moreover, my father had not settled down, so I still referred to him as Yue Ou Chi at that time, which was more accurate.","Although my grandma had become a swan in the sorghum fields, and although she'd taken on the partial guilt for my father's sin, Granddad, as the son of a local playboy, was not yet a man of firmness or stability. He was still a greenhorn, and so I think it's more accurate to call him Yu Zhan'ao.","Even though my grandma had already made love to him in the sorghum field, conceiving my father – a man of both virtue and vice, and one of Northeast Gaomi Township's most romantic figures – during that solemn ceremony, half suffering, half joy; even though my father had not yet been born, she was still the legal wife of another man, and her union with Granddad was illicit, casual, accidental, and unstable. So, when talking about that time, it seems more appropriate to call him Yu Zhan'ao."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Well, I have left a pig on my face for right now, but there is no one willing to pay for that; why not just leave a pig, and it will be good.""","I'm very pleased then, he said,嗯，左边脸上涂上几道牛粪。没人肯花钱给牛粪,那右边脸上当然该什么猪画什么啦,生意好得立刻满脸现目!","He was very pleased with himself, saying, ""Hmm. I'll make a pile of cow dung on my right side, no one will buy it because there's nobody who wants to pay for cow dung, so why not try making a pile of pig dung instead? It's big and stupid, so business should be good.""","Good!' said Old Colour, pleased with his own cleverness. 'A cow-pat! No one can beat you at cow-pats, man! You'll be rich, you know!'","He was quite pleased with himself, saying, ""Well, carving a face full of cow dung on the right side might not attract buyers, as no one would pay for cow dung. It's better to carve a pig instead; it's fat and stupid, ensuring good business.""","Then again, ' he said, 'if I刻 a big pile of cowshit on my right cheek, I'd never get anyone to pay money for it. Better carve a pig. They're fat and stupid. I'll sell a lot of them.'","He said, ""Yes, I'm very pleased. It's better to carve a pig instead of cow dung. Pigs are fat and stupid, so business will be good.""","He was very pleased with his little witticism. 'No one will want to buy a pig-cake made from one of the back legs,'he muttered to himself. 'I'd rather carve a pig-cake altogether. At any rate it would be fattier and stupider. That's the sort of pig-cake to please a customer.'","He was quite pleased with himself, saying, ""Well, a face carved with a heap of cow dung might not attract buyers, as no one pays for cow dung. But carving a pig, which is both fat and foolish, would definitely be a better bet.""","He was rather pleased with himself, saying, ""Well, a pile of cow dung on the right cheek won't do; no one will pay for that. Better make it a pig, fat and stupid, that's sure to be a hit.""",Thumbs! You've done a bull's shit on my right cheek! I'd have to pay someone to get that removed! I'll carve a pig instead. Pigs are stupid and fat. I'll sell a lot of them.',"He is quite proud, saying: ""Ah, carve a pile of cow dung on the right side of my face, but no one will pay money to buy cow dung. It would be better to carve a pig, both fat and stupid, the business will definitely be good.""","He was pleased with this suggestion. 'Right, then. We'll have a pig instead of a cow. Pigs are cheaper. And they're just as fat and stupid. A better investment, definitely.'","He was rather pleased with his idea. 'Hmmm,' he said. 'I could carve a cow-pat on the right cheek, but I don't suppose anyone would pay me for a cow-pat. I know! I'll carve a pig. Pigs are fat and stupid, so I'm sure there would be a big demand for them.'"

薛蟠忙道：“好兄弟，我原为求你快些出来，就忘了忌讳这句话，改日你要哄我，也说我父亲，就完了。”,"'Now look here, old chap,' said Xue Pan, getting agitated, 'it was only because I wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker.

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes. 'You're just like I imagined. Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.'","He changed his image on the media, wearing a suit and appearing well-dressed, ""You guys look like you're elite people. The book is for your class, its essence and意境，most common people can't understand it; play with knowledge that level of depth and content of the book is also uncommonly high.""","The man changed dramatically from the one he appeared in the news, in order to ease the officers' suspicions. He wore a pair of dress shirts and pants, and had a refined air of taste. 'You're not different from the ordinary poor professional who reads Three Body. These are people who can only understand basic concepts—and requiring vast knowledge at a fundamental level is no小事。 But with Three Body, you need not be concerned about the substances of the earth—you just need to know these things—in order to appreciate them.'","He has changed his usual squalid homeless man look on the media, now he is dressed up in a suit and looks very elegant, ""you guys are almost as I imagined, all of you are elite people, The Three Body is made for you guys, its content and意境, is beyond common person's understanding; knowledge needed to play it, its level is too high and contents are too deep, also beyond common people to have.""","Instead of the dirty-rickied street bum he normally appeared on television, he was dressed in a neat suit with polished leather shoes, looking sharp and well-dressed. 'You're about my age,' he said, referring to the show business crowd. 'Three Body was prepared for people like us . . . the level and depth of its内涵和意境, are beyond the understanding of common folk like us.'","He shed his usual appearance of a scruffy street person from the media, dressed in a suit and tie, exuding elegance.

The knowledge required to play it reaches such heights and depth that even ordinary people can't possess it.""","Gone was his usual appearance of a dirty tramp in the media; now he was wearing a suit, looking debonair. ""You’re pretty much as I expected: elites. The Three-Body game is designed for your class. Its depth and artistic conception are beyond ordinary people’s comprehension. The knowledge required to play it is also of such a high level and profundity that it is unattainable by ordinary people.""","He was a complete contrast to the dirty, homeless man he usually was on TV. Fully dressed in a suit and tie, he appeared refined. 'I can see you are much like I imagined. All elites. Three Body is prepared for people like you. The book contains ideas and feelings that ordinary people cannot understand. To appreciate it, you need a high level of knowledge and a deep understanding of complex ideas.","He has changed from his usual hobo-like appearance in the media, wearing a suit and leather shoes, giving off an elegant vibe. ""You are similar to what we imagined, you are elite individuals. 'Three-Body Problem' was prepared for people like you.

Dressed in a suit and leather dress shoes, he came across as a stylish gentleman. 'You and I are not like the common reader. Three Body is written for people like us. The content and the ideas in the book are too lofty and too deep for the average reader. The knowledge required to play the game is too specialized.'","He had discarded his usual appearance of a dirty tramp and was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, looking quite debonair. 'You are about what I expected. You are all elite. Three Body was prepared for people of your station. The game is rich in connotation and atmosphere, and cannot be understood by ordinary people. The knowledge required to play it is also too advanced and too profound for most people to possess.'"

谁知狗儿利名心重，听如此说，心下便有些活动； 又听他妻子这番话，便笑道：“老老既这么说，况且当日你又见过这姑太太一次，为什么不你老人家明日就去走一遭，先试试风头儿去？”,"Gou-er's cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law, and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife's. 'Well, if it's as you say, Grannie, and being as you've already seen this lady, why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?'","Can you tell me what kind of man his wife is? And then she would say something when I heard her words; and then I would laugh at her because she said that old Auntie has a good heart, but why should I go out and show off my own strength tomorrow?","It was not surprising that Toretto, by habit of memory, remembered all this and gave it new life to他说的典故。 But before he could continue, his wife cut in: 'By your excellent knowledge of Her Ladyship you certainly know more about her than I do! Why, if we had been actually to see her, we should never guess there was such a person amongst us!'","The owner of the dog was a man who valued his name very much. Hearing this, he felt a little anxious. He then heard his wife's words and said with a smile, ""Since you've already seen the auntie before, why don't you go for a walk tomorrow? You can try it out.""","Dogar, for his part, was a strong-minded young man who, though flattered by all this, did not like to be bambooned. He heard his wife's account of the previous evening's interview with Mrs Lian with interest; but as soon as he had finished hearing her last sentence, he detected a glint in her eye which indicated that there was more to this than met the eye, so he gave her a big grin: 'If you say so, Miss,' he said. 'And since you saw her once before, I think it won't hurt to take a look round for a taste of the wind.'","Who would have known that Wo Dog's pursuit of fame and wealth was so strong that upon hearing these words, his mind began to stir. After listening to his wife's explanation, he chuckled, ""Grandfather, you've said it so strongly that I recall you meeting this aunt once before. Why didn't you go visit her yourself? Perhaps you could go tomorrow to test the waters?""","Now that Gou-er had got a taste of what success might bring, he was ready to be swayed by this last argument. 'Come, now,' he said, 'you say we ought to do this. After all, don't you remember meeting this Lady Jia once before? Why don't you go there yourself tomorrow and feel the pulse first, eh? Find out what the weather's like?'","Who knows if the dog has a name, but his heart is heavy. Listening to him say so much, his heart starts to move. Then when he hears his wife's words, he laughs and says, ""Since my old man said so, and since you've already met this lady once, why don't you go tomorrow and try out the wind?""","In spite of the somewhat cryptic nature of all this speech, it produced a certain effect on Gou-er and his wife. The old woman's remarks touched his weak spot; and the wife's followed speech and the reminder of the lady's visit to their quarters in the past seemed to decide him. 'Well, if you think it's a good idea, Mrs Li,' he said, forcing a smile, 'why shouldn't you go? You can try out the coast, as they say, and see what the wind's like?","Who would have known that Doggy, driven by his ambition for wealth and fame, was moved by these words and began to consider his options. Upon hearing her husband's wife speak thus, he chuckled, ""Given that you feel so strongly about this, and considering that you've met this aunt once before, why not, as a gesture of goodwill, visit tomorrow? Perhaps you could test the waters and see how things stand.""","Who knew that Doggie was ambitious? Hearing this, he started to waver. Then hearing his wife’s words, he laughed and said, ""Since Old Elderly has spoken thus, and you have met Lady once before, why don’t you go and sound her out tomorrow?""","Yet despite his apparent callousness Gou-er was a man of进取之心, and though he listened with some interest to Jia Huan's words, he needed further encouragement before he would consider taking any practical step. When he heard Jia Huan's account of his own interview with Lady Wang, he said: 'Oh grandmother, you say you know Her Old Ladyship; and you tell us that you were there once before. Why don't you go there again yourself tomorrow, to feel the pulse? See how she feels about us.'","Who knows that a dog's name is heavy in his heart, hearing such words, there is some activity in my heart; furthermore, hearing his wife say this, he laughed and said: ""Since you say it like that, moreover, on that day you didn't see that aunt even once, why don't you go see her tomorrow, try to test the wind and see?""","Little Gou-er's interest was now thoroughly aroused and he waited anxiously for her answer. When she mentioned the servant's comment about there being a way of getting hold of some of the money, he could not forbear a little joke at the servant's expense: 'If what the old woman says is true, Mrs Li, why don't you ask her to let you go and try it out for yourself tomorrow? You know, it's perfectly all right for you to go and try it out first, since you were there on the day she died.'","But the prospect of profit had a powerful appeal to Gou-er, who was a rather grasping young man, and he smiled at his wife's suggestion. 'If that's how you feel, why shouldn't you go round there tomorrow and sound them out a bit? You did, after all, meet this cousin of theirs once.'"

这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。,"It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.","The people who speak of themselves as the ""Sage"" have their minds set on a certain fate - to be served by someone else's will. They all hope that they would get what was supposed to be theirs. But when the time comes for them to take responsibility, it is often placed upon them, and so they can no longer stand in the way of such decisions.","It was common among these errant Taoists for their practitioners to be called Master or Leader; and with good grace, too, in fact, they would seem to imply, just as all participants in this riddle must have already guessed by now that no one knew the real truth—and in fact, under the aegis of their master, they had in reality agreed unilaterally to its existence, so that their own contribution was all that mattered. In due course it was to the master's name that each participant was relegated—neither wanting nor being willing to put in a vote. So future history would never know about this.","These people spoke of themselves as ""masters"" when they spoke highly of themselves, saying things like ""waiting for the master's orders"", but each had already made up their minds about what should be done, just waiting for a nod from the Master of Scent. Once they were given the nod, everything would fall on the Master of Scent, so they wouldn't have any responsibility for anything serious in the future.","These boys would flatter him by calling him Master Zhang, and professing to be waiting for his instructions. But deep down inside they had already made up their minds what to do. All it needed was for Master韦 to agree, and all of them would then be relieved of any further responsibility.","These people, who call themselves the Grand Incense Master with their mouths, and constantly speak of waiting for the Grand Incense Master's instructions, actually have their own plans in mind. They hope that these plans will be approved by him. As a result, all decisions are attributed to the Grand Incense Master. This way, they won't bear any significant responsibility in the future.","These people would stand respectfully at the door calling him 'Elder' and all the time they were thinking, 'He won't give us any trouble if we do this; it'll all get laid at his door. He won't have to worry about it; it won't involve him in any major obligations.'","These people refer to themselves as ""Master"" and boast about how they are waiting for the Master's orders, but in reality, they already have their own ideas in mind and are just seeking approval from the Master. They will shift all responsibilities onto the Master's shoulders, so that they will not have to bear the consequences themselves in the future.","These individuals, who referred to themselves as 'the Master of Incense', would utter phrases like 'wait for the Master's commands' and 'as the Master instructs'.

That way, they could pin everything on Leader Wei, so they wouldn’t have to bear any responsibility later on.","Although they addressed him as 'Elder', their real intention was to get what they wanted, and to shift the blame for carrying it out onto his shoulders. That way they would not have to answer for the outcome of the enterprise themselves.","These people refer to themselves as the ""incense master,"" constantly uttering phrases like ""wait for the incense master's orders"" or ""the incense master's will.""

His neck felt stiff, his eyes were growing dull and listless, and his only thought was that as long as he could tag along behind Uncle Arhat to the Black Water River he'd never come back empty-handed.","His hand was tightly gripping the sleeve of General Su's uniform, partly because he walked, partly because Su was dragging them along. He found himself a little sleepy as he thought about it. His neck stiffened and his eyes were dull and rigid. Father thinks that if he went with the monk to the water well at Ruojiang River, there wouldn't be any reason for him not to come back.","He kept holding him by the collar, pulling him along as if on his own, yet it was getting dark and he gets dizzy from the lack of food.

But Father reasoned that as long as he followed Uncle Arhat to the Black Water River, we wouldn't return empty-handed.","He clung tightly to the corner of General Yu's robe, half walking and half being led forward by him. He felt a drowsiness creeping up on him, his neck stiff and his eyes dull. Father said, there was no point in returning empty-handed if he went with Lao Han to the ink river.","He held on to Commander Yu's coat, almost dragging him down the road.

Father thought that if Granduncle took him to the Ink River there was no way they would come back empty-handed.","Holding on to Commander Yu's coat, he walked half with his own feet and half with Commander Yu's; he felt sleepy, the back of his neck was stiff, and his eyes were dry.

Father thought, if they followed the monk to the Ink River, there would be no reason to return empty-handed.","He held tightly to Commander Yu's coat, half dragging himself forward, until his body froze into a rigid sleep-like trance. His stiff neck, his dry, staring eyes: Father thought, If we just keep going with Uncle Arhat, we won't have come back empty-handed.","All the while he held tightly to Commander Yu's coat, half walking on his own, half being pulled along, until he grew drowsy. His neck was stiff, his eyes dry and inflexible, but he knew that if he followed Uncle Arhat to the Black Water River they wouldn't come back empty-handed."

你只顾一时为我得罪了人，他们都记在心里，遇着坎儿，说的好说不好听的，大家什么意思呢？”,"You don't seem to realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you've forgotten all about it. But they haven't. It's all scored up against me; and as soon as something goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it so unpleasant for all of us.'","Only by being a little harsh with me did you offend them all, and they will remember this for what it is worth; when they meet trouble, do you say good or bad?""",But how can you expect to get away from them if you merely focus on that one goal of yours?',"Only you have been offended me for a moment; they all remember it. When they come across difficulties, what do they mean by saying something good or bad?""","All the friends that you have offended will keep records of it.

They will say what they like, but they will always intend to make your life difficult.'","You might have offended some people for a moment, but they all remember it.

All those grudges piled up inside me—it's not going to be pleasant for anyone concerned.'","""Although you may have offended someone for a moment, they will remember it and hold a grudge. Saying good things about me is not easy, so what do you think everyone else means when they encounter obstacles?""","And you go offending people left, right and center, without stopping to consider the consequences. You never think how they will feel when they hear that you have been set upon Kan-er. You will find yourself in a pretty pickle, I can tell you. You will have made yourself very unpopular.'","You may have offended some people for a moment, but they all remember it. When things get tough, whatever you say will be criticized, what kind of impression is that?""","You offended people for my sake just for a moment, and they've taken it to heart. When they hit a bump in the road, whether they speak well of you or not, what do they all mean by that?""","And besides, you can't go offending other people on my account all the time. You never know what sort of trouble it may lead to. You'd better not do anything to make them dislike you.'","You've only offended someone for a moment, but they remember it in their hearts. When they encounter a slight problem, they speak in a harsh and unkind manner. What does everyone mean by that?""","But if in the heat of the moment you offend one of them, they all hold it against you. So when you meet up with Kang Er or any of the others, you never know what they'll say.","You may think you're helping me by offending them now; but they will remember it, and when we come to some difficulty later on, they may say things to us, good or bad, which would be unpleasant for all of us.'"

像她们这样半路上的朋友，各有各的隐衷，别看严家师母竹筒倒豆子，内中也有自己未必知道的保留，彼此并不知根知底，能有一些同情便可以了。,"People like them, who become friends at mid-life, tend to keep part of themselves hidden away. Even Madame Yan, who usually wore her heart on her sleeve, retained certain secrets that she herself might not have understood. It was not necessary for them to know everything there was to know about each other—a little sympathy went a long way.","Like this kind of friend who meets every now and then on their way, each with his or her own hidden thoughts, look at your grandmother’s inner sanctum, there is also something that she may not know, so don’t just say something, but can some empathy be gained?","People like them who came and went in and out of their lives, who nobody knew anything about; besides, since they couldn't tell what was going on inside the family, they could provide some sympathy without fully understanding.","As for the friends we make halfway along the way, each of them has their own secrets; don’t look at how Mrs. Zhi pours out her beans from a bamboo barrel; there may be some secrets she doesn’t know herself. We don’t know each other’s backgrounds either, so it would be enough if we can show some sympathy.","If they were not already friends, their relationships would have to begin somewhere—somewhere presumably where each was keeping something back. Maybe Madame Yan had known all along that she couldn't confide everything with Wang Qiyao, or perhaps Wang Qiyao had no idea how deeply Madame Yan had felt about The Little Countess. They entered into one another's lives gradually, and a simple word of comfort was more than enough.","Friends like them, who join along the way, each have their own secrets. Despite Aunt Yan, the master of the Yan household, pouring out her heart like a bamboo spout, there are also things she herself may not be fully aware of that she keeps back. Given that we don't know each other's roots and origins, it's enough to have some empathy for each other.","As for those who had made friends with Wang Qiyao on her way up in the world, each had her own secrets. Although Madame Yan talked nonstop, her friends did not necessarily know all her thoughts; they were not required to return her confessions in kind. They were not in any way obliged to understand one another.","Like these friends who met halfway, each has their own hidden feelings. Don't look at the elder's strict demeanor, for there may be things she hasn't disclosed. Even if we don't know each other's roots, a little sympathy can go a long way.","And as for Madame Yan's new friends, they, too, had their own hidden motives; you should never imagine that she poured out her troubles to them all in a single sitting. There are some things that even friends don't know about each other; in order to have a true understanding you need to be able to put yourself in the other person's shoes—this you can do if you have a little compassion.","Friends like them, who join the group midway, each have their own secrets. Although Mrs. Yan, the teacher's wife, seems to pour out everything like a bamboo spout, there are still parts of herself that she may not even be aware of, reserving some of her knowledge. Given that we don't know each other well, it would be sufficient to show some empathy.","Friends by the way like them had their own hidden feelings. Although Mrs. Yan seemed as open as beans spilling out of a bamboo tube, she too held back things even she herself might not know about. Neither knew the other through and through, so a little sympathy was enough.","Like these half-way friends, each had her own secrets; even though Madame Yan talked nonstop, her friends did not know the whole story. They were grateful for even a glimpse of her inner self.","As with her friends walking along the way, each has their own intentions, don't be deceived by Madam Zhu of the Zhu family pouring beans into a bamboo tube, there may be things they themselves don't know about her reservations. They don't know each other's roots or bottoms, a little sympathy is enough.","Friends like them had to content themselves with a partial understanding of one another; neither knew the depths of the other's reservations, but that was enough for them.","Friends of convenience like them each had her own secrets. Madame Yan may have spilled her beans like a man emptying a bamboo tube, but there was still a lot that she herself was not aware of. They were not close enough to know each other's deepest secrets; as long as they could show some sympathy for one another, that was enough."
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'",Qian Shuhong wanted to know what a Heavenly Pavilion穴和环跳穴是什么意思，怎么点穴，解穴，但他转过头来想了想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴都不会，难道会让下属们太也瞧不起吗？反正对付一个小姑娘也不是什么难事，点头回答：“知道啦。”,"So Trinket asked what these terms were worth, and how to use them, and wondered how it was possible to tap a place or to dislocate a place; but he thought about the fact that I was the Helmsman's grandson and the Helmsman himself was my grounds keeper's son, and besides, even if I couldn't do anything about a little girl, at least I could find her out in the first place. Well, of course I knew all that, though I didn't know any of this from being here at the base. What's more, I already had a小姑娘。","Wu Xiaoya wanted to ask him what a god temple meridian and how to point or release it, but he turned his thoughts to himself as he was the chief of the Green Wood Hall and the disciple of the Grand Master. He didn’t even know how to do these things. What would the subordinates think of him? Anyway, dealing with a little girl wouldn’t be too difficult. So he nodded and said, “I’ve understood.”","Trinket wondered if he had heard her correctly: 'Chambers' and 'Leng Jiatang,' he said, rather than问他是怎样点穴位和解穴。","Vixiao Bao was about to ask him what a 'shen tang xue' or 'huan ti xue' were, and how to apply pressure points and relieve them. But then he thought, as the head of the Green Wood Hall and a disciple of the Grand Master, not knowing how to apply pressure points or relieve them would make his subordinates look down on him. In any case, dealing with a young girl wouldn't be too difficult, so he nodded and said, ""I understand.""","It occurred to Trinket to ask what a 'doubling point' was, and how one went about stimulating it or unlocking it; but then he remembered that he was the leader of the Green Wood Lodge and had even been taken on as the Helmsman's apprentice. He thought that the members of his Lodge would probably think him very silly if they knew that he didn't know the answer to such a question. In any case, he told himself, it shouldn't be very difficult to subdue a girl—even if she did have a doubling point! So he nodded and said: 'Yes, I understand.'","""Ah, you want to know what's called the Shinto Ancestor's Tomb and how to use it? I can't tell you that, but it's not a big deal. I'm the head of the Green Wood Temple and the disciple of the overall master. I don't know how to use it, but it's not a big deal. After all, dealing with a little girl is not a difficult task. I understand now.""","Trinket was about to ask him what the Holy Hall and Ring-a-Joke were, and how you went about closing them off and opening them up again, but reflected that as the future Helmsman of the Mighty Society of Woodentop Perfumers he shouldn't admit to not knowing things he didn't know, lest he make a fool of himself in the eyes of the other Initiates; so merely nodded and said: 'Yes, Goong-goong!'","Wei Xiaobao was about to ask him what a divine meridian point or a circular spring point was, and how to apply pressure on them or release them, but then he thought: as the head of the Green Wood Sect and a disciple of the sect leader, not knowing how to apply pressure points or release them would surely make my subordinates look down on me. Anyway, dealing with a little girl shouldn't be too difficult, so he nodded and said, ""I understand.""","Wesley wanted to ask what the Shentang acupoint and Huantiao acupoint were, as well as how to seal and release acupoints, but then he thought that since he was the Fragrant Master of the Green Pine Hall and also the Chief’s disciple, wouldn’t it be too much for his subordinates to look down on him if he didn’t even know how to seal and release acupoints? Anyway, dealing with a little girl wasn’t supposed to be difficult. He nodded and said, ""I see.""","Trinket was going to ask him what a 'shen point' or a 'gutter jump' was, and how one went about opening them up again, when he reflected that as the leader of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the Lodge's Helmsman he ought surely to know already. Besides, it would be humbling to have to admit that he didn't know. He merely nodded. 'Yes, I know.'","Wei Xiaobao asked about what ""God Hall Hole"" and ""Ring Jump Hole"" are, how to press and release them, but then he thought, as a junior disciple of the Green Wood Hall and the overall helmsman, not knowing how to press and release points would make his subordinates look down on him. After all, dealing with a young lady should not be a difficult task, he nodded and said: ""Understood.""","Trinket was about to ask him what he meant, but a sudden fear took possession of him that the Helmsman was merely being modest and that in fact he did know how to do it; otherwise he would not have said he didn't. Better not to know, he thought, lest it should appear that he was looking down on the girl. 'I know what you mean,' he said.","Trinket was on the point of asking what the Shenting and Ring Jump points were, and how one went about closing them and reopening them; but then he reflected that as the head of the Green Wood Lodge and the Helmsman's apprentice, he ought not to admit his ignorance of such basic matters.

父亲，一九五七年，你躲在我家里间屋里那个地洞里时，你每日每夜，在永恒的黑暗中，追忆流水年月，你至少三百六十次想到了我们家那几十间房屋的屋盖在大火中塌落的情景。 你想到你的父亲我的爷爷在那时刻想到了什么，我的幻想紧追着你的幻想，你的幻想紧追着爷爷的思维。,"Father, when you were hiding in the burrow we dug for you in the floor of my home back in 1957, you recalled those days of your past in the unrelenting darkness. On no fewer than 365 occasions, in your mind you saw the roof of your house crash down amid the flames, and wondered what was going through the mind of your father, my granddad. So my fantasies were chasing yours while yours were chasing Granddad's.","The father, in 1957, when you were hiding in my house at the bottom of a cave that I had dug in the ground, your daily nights were filled with memories of the endless night of the burning years of our family’s houses, from the scene of the fire which had destroyed so many of them. You thought about what my grandfather would have thought, as he did not see it coming; your thoughts followed his thought process, and his thoughts followed mine.","In 1957, Father was hiding you in your room at home where you spent every day, staring into the abyss of darkness. You could picture the walls of our houses that had supported the family business, now collapsing before your eyes in the great blaze of fire. You followed your father's imagination as closely as he could, and you followed my dream as it tightened around his brain.","My father, you hid in my house's underground room during the year 1957, when you would recall the past with each passing day in the eternal darkness, at least three hundred sixty times thinking about our family's houses that had been destroyed by fire. Your thoughts were filled with your grandfather's thoughts of his own father at that moment, and I followed them closely.","In 1957, during the terrifying days when you hid in one of the cellars to escape the state-run farm's nightly orgy of arson, you recounted, with words and images, the tragic collapse of the roof over a dozen or so rooms, just the thought that your father, your grandfather, was screaming for help as the flames ate away at the building, driving home your fantasy with the speed and precision of a runner chasing a dream.","Father, in 1957 when you hid in the small underground room of my house, every night in the eternal darkness, you must have recalled your youth 360 times. You pondered what your father, my grandfather, was thinking at that moment when our family's dozens of roof tiles fell down in flames. My imagination followed your imagination, and your imagination pursued the thoughts of my grandfather.","In 1957, when you hid in the small room under the ground, did you spend every night recalling how the fires consumed our hundreds of interconnected rooms? As you thought about your father, my granddad, who thought about our family home burning to the ground, your imagination followed mine, and my imagination followed yours.","Father, in 1957, you were hiding in the cave behind my house, and every day and every night, you were lost in the eternal darkness, imagining the scene of our house collapsing into ashes. You must have thought of your father, my grandfather, and his thoughts were chasing after your thoughts. Your thoughts were chasing after his thoughts.","Father, you hid out in the underground tunnel between our two houses in 1957, and every day and every night you chased after the image of our villages' houses burning, at least three hundred sixty times. You probably thought about what your father, Granddad, was thinking about at that moment. Your thoughts chased after his.","Father, in the tiny underground room at my house in 1957, every night and day in eternal darkness, you must have recalled your youth, and you must have thought of the collapse of our family's roof under the fire a minimum of 360 times. You pondered what your father, my grandfather, was thinking at that moment, and my imagination followed your imagination, and your imagination followed Grandfather's thoughts.","Father, when you hid in the cellar under our inner room in 1957, as you relived the years gone by day after day and night after night in that eternal darkness, you must have recalled at least 360 times the scene of our family’s dozens of houses collapsing in flames. I follow your imagination, which in turn chases after Grandfather’s thoughts, and wonder what he was thinking at that moment.","In 1957, when you hid in the little room under the floorboard, you thought of our family of more than three hundred times per night, as you tried to recall the fire that had destroyed the roof of our house. You wondered what your grandfather, my father, was thinking during those moments, so I followed your thoughts and your thoughts followed his thoughts.","Father, in 1957, when you hid in the secret hole in our house, you remembered the flowing years and months every day and night. At least 360 times, you thought about the sight of our many houses with their roofs collapsing in the fire. You wondered what my grandfather, your father, was thinking at that moment. My imagination closely followed your imagination, which in turn closely followed my grandfather's thoughts.

Translation:
In 1957, while hiding in the secret hole in our house, you often remembered the flowing years and months. At least 360 times, you thought about the sight of our many houses with their roofs collapsing in the fire. You wondered what my grandfather, your father, was thinking at that moment. My imagination closely followed your imagination, which in turn closely followed my grandfather's thoughts.","In 1957, when you hid in the root cellar under the house, every day and every night, in the eternal darkness, you recalled the images of the flooded villages and the houses collapsing under the fire, and you wondered what was going through Granddad's mind then. My imagination always followed yours, and your imagination followed Granddad's thoughts.","Father, in 1957, when you were hiding in the burrow beneath our bedroom, as you relived the past in the eternal darkness, you must have recalled at least three hundred sixty times how our house burned, wondering what your father, my grandfather, was thinking as the roof of our house collapsed; my imagination chases yours, which chases his."

Then, in a hazy state of mind, she realized that this must be her eternal home, her own personal hell. The three suns would continue to scorch her for all eternity, the supermax punishment for her ultimate betrayal.","This went on for a long time, until she fell into a semiconscious state. This might be her eternal destination—her hell, where she would be roasted by the fires of three suns. This was the punishment for her supreme act of betrayal."
下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","In the afternoon, she came for injections at 3 or 4 o'clock, and this hour was empty. She was just alone with them, facing each other. The summer sleep had not yet completely disappeared, and she couldn't help but groggy and sleepy. Summer's noontime was still a little off, and she wouldn't stop laughing even when she was very tired. There were so many insects buzzing about in the梧桐树上， one after another they called out in a loud voice, and it didn’t make sense.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early in the three o'clock time, when all three of them were sitting together, their eyes stretched out waiting for sleep to take hold. Summer fatigue still had not completely gone, and they fell into a riddle-free dream while huddling against the scorching sun of noontime, whereupon they forced themselves to recall what it was that had waddled up under their feet from somewhere outside. Their oak tree's sparrows chirped alit and sang with loud whistling as if not aware of each other's presence.",They came for shots at 3 or 4 PM. This hour was always empty. They were just the two of them. Sitting face to face. Their heads aching with exhaustion from the summer sleep they had taken earlier. They tried their best to force themselves awake. The crickets chirped loudly outside the window. It sounded like buzzing. They couldn't understand what it was saying.,"They usually came in at three or four o'clock, and this hour was empty at the hospital. Two women sitting face to face, they would wake up from their drowsies every now and then and stretch out their legs toward each other, conscious of the overhead梧桐树上不息的蝉鸣，此起彼伏的只是它们那模糊的声响。","Injections were usually administered between three and four in the afternoon, during this hour when they were alone together, facing each other. The drowsiness of a summer afternoon was still lingering, and yawns were frequent. They made an effort to stay awake, but neither of them could recall what they had said. The cicadas on the mulberry tree outside their window kept up a steady chorus, which was muffled by the walls but still present, a vague hum.","The needle punctures usually fell between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. This hour seemed to be empty in the clinic, with only the nurse and the patient facing each other. The drowsiness of the summer afternoon had not completely passed, and they could barely keep their heads up. They spoke little, and their conversation was inaudible to one another, like the muffled buzz of the cicadas outside the window.","Afternoon injections are usually at around three o'clock, and during this hour, they sit facing each other, with nothing to say. The afternoon drowsiness has not yet fully passed, and they cannot help yawning. They try to keep their spirits up, but they don't know what to say. The cicadas on the mulberry tree outside are buzzing loudly, but it's unclear what they are saying.","Most of the afternoons found them there from three to four, when the afternoon slump had not yet passed and yawns were unavoidable. They tried to be alert, but often could not think of anything to say, as the shrubs outside the window filled the room with the loud buzzing of cicadas.","The needle pricks were usually administered around three or four o'clock in the afternoon, during this one hour when it was just the two of them sitting facing each other. The drowsiness from their post-midday nap hadn't fully dissipated, causing them to yawn repeatedly. They tried to keep themselves awake, but neither could recall what they had said. The cicadas on the梧桐 trees outside kept chirping incessantly, their sounds muffled and indistinct as they echoed in the room.","Those who came for injections in the afternoon usually arrived around three or four, so there was always an empty hour when it was just the two of them sitting facing each other. The drowsiness of summer afternoons had still not quite passed, and they could not stop yawning. They tried to keep their spirits up but did not know what they were saying. The cicadas in the sycamore outside buzzed incessantly, and their sound came in muffled and indistinct.","The hour between three and four in the afternoon used to find them face-to-face, their conversation stifled by yawns during those summer afternoons. They forced themselves to stay alert, but their words were incoherent, and the chattering of the phoenix trees outside added no clarity to their conversation.","Afternoon appointments for acupuncture are usually around three or four o'clock, and during that hour, it's always empty, just the two of them, facing each other. The drowsiness of the summer afternoon hadn't completely passed, and they couldn't help but yawn repeatedly. They tried to stay alert, not knowing what to say. The cicadas on the mulberry tree chirped in a repetitive pattern, and the sound was muffled, also unclear.","Their afternoons were often spent giving each other shots, and on those hot summer afternoons, when everyone else was taking a nap, the two of them would sit across from each other, trying to stay awake. They spoke in hushed tones, their conversation inaudible to the man, who could only hear the buzzing of the dragonflies rising up from the willow tree by the entrance to the alley.","Wu Peizhen usually came in the afternoon around three or four o'clock, so they would have an hour or so of down time. Still feeling the drowsiness of a summer afternoon, they sat across from one another, yawn after yawn. They struggled to keep their spirits up and often did not even know what they were talking about. The cicadas in the plane trees at the entrance to the longtang droned on and on, their cries muffled and unrecognizable."

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","I have understood his intentions when I heard what he had said. For instance, he knew that the previous incident where his father-in-law had bought land from him was due to the dog’s power of his father. Now, when he saw that you are now so rich, it makes him hard to be satisfied; also, he wants to show off his own dignity. He smiled and said: ""Old old, don’t worry.","By this time her husband's words had already tipped the balance. It was that he had obtained so much land by way of inheritance竞赛， that Trinket's father had actually awarded him a sum for his labour; yet though he had no say in the matter, Grannie Liu was hoping that he would give her some satisfaction. So assuming grumblings like that as accurate as fact, she decided that it was up to them to conceal their amuse. 'Of course, Old Colour,' she said, 'you can go about restising as you please.","Wang Ru's heard it all and guessed what was going on. His husband had bought a plot of land in the past with his father-in-law's help; seeing how old man Liu is now, he felt hard-pressed for money. He also wanted to show off his status. So he said, ""Old man Liu, you can rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife, already having a vague understanding of the situation, was aware that she had to do something to live up to her friend's expectations, and therefore proceeded to preen her affectionate old friend's feelings in a most gratifying manner. 'Oh, Mr Liu,' she began, 'I can quite understand you coming here. . . .'","Zhou Rui's family, having heard this, already guessed the purpose behind it. It was because of her husband's previous efforts to purchase land, where he had received considerable assistance from Dog Er's father, that she found it hard to refuse the intentions of the elderly lady, R Liu. Additionally, she also wanted to display her own grandeur. She laughed and said, ""Elder lady, have no fears.","Zhou Rui's wife guessed pretty well what had brought Ruo-er's grandmother. Her husband had, some years ago, profited considerably from Gou-er's father's land dealings; and now, since the old lady was so poor, she did not feel it would be wrong to help her, while at the same time showing off a little to her employer. 'Please don't worry,' she said smiling.","When Zhou Rui's family heard about it, they already sensed something. Because his father-in-law had helped him win the land dispute with his wife's family years ago, Zhou Rui felt obligated to show his gratitude. He also wanted to maintain his reputation. So, he laughed and said, ""Older brother, you can rest easy.""","Zhou Rui's wife had pretty well made up her mind what the visit was about, thanks to the recent business over the fields; but she found it hard to summon up the necessary courage and wished to make a good impression in front of Grannie Liu. 'Don't worry about that, Grannie,' she said with a disarming smile, 'you'll find I can look after myself.","Zhou Rui's family, having heard this, already guessed the intent behind it. It was because of his husband's past efforts in purchasing land, where he received much help from Dog Er's father, that Zhou Rui's family found it hard to refuse R Liu's request now. Additionally, they also wanted to display their own status and prestige. Thus, she said with a smile, ""Old lady, please rest assured.""","Mrs. Zhou guessed what was coming. Because her husband had benefited from Father Doggie’s help in a land dispute years before, she found it hard to refuse Grandma Liu’s request. Besides, she wanted to show off her own importance. Smiling, she said, “Don’t worry, Grandma.","Zhou Rui's wife had some notion of what had brought Grannie Liu to their door by virtue of the land transaction which had previously taken place between her husband and Gou Er's father. Accordingly she was loth to refuse her request, partly because it would be ungracious to do so, and partly because she wished to show off a little. 'Please don't worry,' she said with a disarming smile.","Zhou Rui's family understood, guessing a few things from it. It was because his husband had argued over buying land in the past, gaining the favor of his father-in-law, and now seeing Liu Lao Lao in such a state, he couldn't help but suppress his thoughts; secondly, he also wanted to show off his own status. He then said, ""Don't worry, old Liu.""","Zhou Rui's wife had guessed most of this, but the suddenness of its arrival took her by surprise. However, she was well aware of the part that Gou-er's influence had played in gaining them the land all those years ago, and now, in order to save face, she hurried to reassure Grannie Liu. 'Don't worry, old lady. Just leave it all to me.","Zhou Rui's wife guessed what was coming. Some years previously, when her husband had been disputing about a piece of land with another buyer, it had been thanks to Gou-er's father that he had got it in the end; so, in the first place, she felt that she owed them something. In the second place, she wanted to show off her importance. Accordingly she smiled reassuringly at Grannie Liu."

It's not allowed to take care of us here either.","He too wanted to go down to the market, but he had to wait until the authorities decided on our return before letting us stay there unaccompanied—nothing wrong with keeping watch during a market day.","He also wants to go out on the street, but we can’t let him because it’s not allowed.","He also wanted to go out on the street to show off, but the sun wasn't yet going down, so we couldn't let us go without his permission, which we didn't have.","He wanted to go to the market too, but it wasn't time for us to be released yet, leaving us unattended here, which was against the rules.","He wanted to go to the market himself, but he couldn't go until he was supposed to. He didn't want to leave us unattended, and it wasn't proper.","He also wanted to go out, but we couldn't leave until the guards came back. It was against the rules for us to stay here unattended.","He had wanted to go to the market with the others, but it was almost time for us to go back to our respective places, and they didn't want us wandering around unattended.

The supreme leader thus did not pay attention to it, gazing at him for a moment before asking, ""Do you want to become my disciple?""","Most members of the Triad Society drank大量白酒, gambled away their rents, and committed crimes of various descriptions—things that would have got the average member into serious trouble with the Brother Society's Grand Master, who ignored them all and now was regarding the young man with interest. 'I'm willing to take you on as my apprentice, if you want me to.'","The members of the Heaven and Earth Society were all renowned figures on the street, and gambling and drinking were their nature.

In his eyes they had fallen. But the Helmsman did not appear to be aware of this, for he continued to look at his new disciple with a steady gaze. 'Will you be my apprentice?' he asked the younger man.","The members of the Heavenly Earth Society were often martial heroes who gambled and drank, traits that were seen as natural and not wrong.

He stared at him for a moment, then said, ""Do you wish to become my disciple?""","The members of the Triad Society were themselves men of action, gamblers and fighters like their leader. It was a natural enough inclination for them to indulge in these passions, and the latter had never thought it necessary to curb them in himself or his followers. But now he directed his attention for a moment towards Misty and seemed for some moments to be studying him silently. 'Would you like me to be your teacher?' he asked eventually.","The crowd at the Tian Di Hall were numerous, they were the powerful figures of the river-sea world, gambling and drinking, which was their nature, and they had never been concerned about right or wrong. The host, not paying attention to them, looked at him for a moment and asked, ""Would you like to take me as your master?""","Many of the Triad members were, like Butcher Qin, bold and swashbuckling young men who lived by their wits and were accustomed to taking risks. There was nothing unusual about them in this respect, and the Helmsman, observing them for a moment with a slightly concentrated stare, put the question to them quite casually: 'Would any of you like to become my apprentice?'","The triad members were nearly all rough-and-tumble fellows for whom gambling and drinking were a way of life, and for whom these vices therefore did not exist. So the Helmsman had long since given up trying to regulate them. He gazed at Trinket for some moments in silence. 'Would you like to be my apprentice?'"

Even though there were soldiers or civilians coming to help, the flames had already become fierce; how could they get out of it? They burnt for all night, but they did not know how many people had been burned.","Now,' continues the account, 'once we have chosen our bamboo posternums and our thatched walls, it is no matter what for us to accept whatever comes our way; and so, picking at apices one by one, we now have a large enough patch for every one of them, each one containing one or more houses. We have thus burnt off as many as could be had—though, obviously, there were too many of them—and in the end destroyed almost half the place in which they stood. We returned to the flame at night and waited until the fire had died out on its own, counting the houses lost.","This family uses bamboo fences and wooden walls. This is their fate, so they are repeatedly pulled up and dragged down, burning a street like a fire mountain. Even when there were soldiers and civilians to rescue, the fire had become too big. How could they be saved at all? It burned all night before it died down. They didn’t know how many houses were burnt.","The families of Shanghai used bamboo pickets and wooden fences to enclose their streets; it was part of the great scheme of nature that these should, in the course of things, go up in smoke. Straight away there was a rush by the firefighters sent by the military and the civilians to try to contain the flames. The flames, once out of control, consumed houses and buildings without cessation for several days, until they were finally brought under control. How many homes had been burned is unknown.","In this place, every household used bamboo fences and wooden walls, which was destined by fate. As a result, one after another, five and four intertwined, setting fire to the entire street as if it were Mount Flaming Fire. At that time, although soldiers and civilians came to save, the fire had already gained momentum; how could they extinguish it? The fire burned for a whole night before finally dying down, but no one knew how many homes had been destroyed.","In this district people normally used bamboo fencing and wooden walls for their buildings, and it seemed fated that fires should break out there from time to time, and indeed they did, attracting each other like magnets, until the whole street呈现出 the appearance of Mount Flame. Although help came from soldiers and civilians as soon as the alarm was raised, the fire had already got well under way and could not be extinguished. It continued burning for the whole of the night and when it finally died down in the morning it was estimated that it had destroyed the homes of over a hundred families.","This family's house had bamboo fences and wooden walls, and they should have prepared for such a disaster. They then quickly connected five houses together and formed a line, creating a fire that resembled a mountain of flames. Although people from the military came to help, the fire had already become uncontrollable, and it was impossible to save them. The fire burned all night and destroyed many homes.","The walls of the houses were built of bamboo and wood, which in itself, according to the laws of war, was sufficient cause for their being set on fire. The result was a conflagration the like of which had not been seen for many a day, attracting troops of soldiers and civilians who, however, arrived too late to save the town from utter devastation and untold human suffering.","In this place, every household uses bamboo fences and wooden walls, which is the fate that must be so. Consequently, one after another, they linked and intertwined, setting fire to a whole street, turning it into a landscape of fire mountains. Even though military and civilians came to save during that time, the fire had already gained momentum, making it impossible to put out. It burned for an entire night before finally calming down, without anyone knowing how many households were destroyed.","In this place, people used bamboo fences and wooden walls, which were destined to fuel such a disaster. One after another, with five pulled and four dragged along, the entire street was burned down like a mountain of flames. Although soldiers and civilians came to fight the fire at that time, the fire had already gained momentum—how could it be extinguished? It burned for an entire night before it subsided, and no one knew how many homes had been burned down.","In this place people used bamboo fences and wooden walls, and since it was their fate to suffer this way, business went on as usual, marriageable young women were snatched up and married off in batches of twos and threes, and before long the whole street was a Hot Water Mountain of flames, and though the military and civilian firefighters did their best, the fire had by that time gotten well established and could not be put out. It burned for one whole night, during which time it is calculated that not fewer than a hundred families were destroyed.","This method is using bamboo fence and wooden wall, it should be like this in a raid, so they pulled two and connected three, hung four, and set a whole street on fire, like a mountain of fire flames; at that time, there were soldiers and civilians coming to rescue, but the fire had already gained momentum, how could they rescue it? It took a night to extinguish, and it was unknown how many houses were burned down.

Translation: This method used bamboo fences and wooden walls, as it should be in a raid. They connected two, pulled three, hung four, and set a whole street on fire, resembling a mountain of fire flames. Although soldiers and civilians came to rescue, the fire had already gained momentum. It took a night to extinguish, and it was unknown how many houses were burned down.","The method the Manchu defenders used to protect themselves against such attacks was to barricade the approaches with hedges and stockades of bamboo and kindling. By the time the Dutch and the Manchus had burned their way deep into the city, it was too late to put the fire out. Men, women, and children were burnt to death in their homes. The fire continued to burn all night long, and no one knows how many houses were destroyed.","The houses in that part of the town were all built of wood and bamboo, and it was fated that they should all go up in flames. The conflagration spread from house to house until the whole street looked like a mountain of fire. Soldiers and citizens came rushing to its extinction, but by the time they arrived the fire had got such a hold that their efforts were useless. It burned all through the night before it finally died down, and when it did so, no one could tell how many houses had been destroyed."

韦小宝记得茅十八在酒馆中与七名大汉相斗的手法，突然左手出拳，击向那男孩下颚，砰的一声，正好打中。,"Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek.","I remember seeing Ye Minbao's hand strike at that boy on the bar, his fist striking right down the middle of his jaw. It was a bang!","He happened upon Whiskers' account of what had happened when the drunk boy was fighting with other boys in the same bar: he had a left hand outrange which, when hit, neatly struck its owner's颚, which thunked hard and caused it to fall down.","Wu Xiaoliao remembered how Mao Daji had fought seven men at a tavern with his left hand. Suddenly, he struck the boy’s chin with his left hand. A loud thud echoed as it hit home.","As Trinket was thinking, 'Now I've got to hit the boy on the side of the head,' he saw Whiskers, the Pocky Bear, coming at him from round the corner with a look of murderous intent on his face. He had already seen him approach when he made a sudden fist explode from under his right arm and smack home the boy's neck.","Wu Xiaobao remembered how Ma Shaoci had fought seven big men in a tavern, and suddenly he threw his left fist forward to strike the boy's jaw. There was a loud bang as it hit just right.","Trinket had seen a similar move in the inn earlier, when Whiskers had punched one of the seven Eunuchs. He decided to try it out on the boy. It worked perfectly.","Vie Xiao Bao remembered the way Zhuge Liang had used his left hand to punch a man's chin in the tavern. Suddenly, he punched the boy's chin with his left hand, and it made a loud sound, hitting it perfectly.","Trinket remembered Whiskers' fight in the tavern with the seven brothers.

韦小宝道：“不降！” 欲待挺腰翻起，蓦地里腰间一阵酸麻，后腰两处穴道已被小玄子屈指抵住，那正是海老公昨晚所教的手法，自己虽然学会了，却给对方抢先用出。,"'No! Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back. Misty had beaten him to it! He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.","Wu Zai Ba said, ""I won't!"" He wanted to stand up and raise his legs, but suddenly he felt a pain on his back when his arms were being hit by Min Cheng's thumb. That was the way Min Cheng taught him last night, even though he had learned it.","No!' cried Trinket, as his back was rounding out, and aches and pains welled up in those little holes beneath his clothes. Not far from where his waist was tied by Misty, there were two places in his costume which Misty had already managed to slam shut with a press of his finger. 'I'm not going!'","Wu Xiaoya said: ""No surrender!"" He wanted to stand up but suddenly felt a numbness in his waist, two points of meridians on his back were blocked by Little Nine's fingers. These were the same technique that Sea Husband taught him last night. Although he had learned it, it was given away by the other party.","No!' Trinket shouted, though it was clearly too late for that. The next thing he became aware of was a stabbing pain in his lower back, and the hand on his waist told him that it was being pressed by Misty's. It was the same trick the old eunuch had taught him the day before, but now it had been used against him.","Vong Kai Bao"" said, ""I won't surrender!"" Just as he was about to lift his body up, suddenly he felt a numbing sensation in his waist, and it turned out that Xiao Xuanzi had pressed his two acupuncture points on his lower back with his fingers, exactly the method taught by Old Man Sea from last night. Although he had learned it, his opponent had used it before him.","No!' protested Trinket, as he reached for the switchblade and began to rock back on his haunches. But a sudden spasm of pain darted through his lower back and he found that Misty had him by the throat again, this time with his back to the floor. It was the same trick the old eunuch had taught him, though Trinket had learned it already—and now he was the one who was too late.",I will not yield! I will not give in! I will not be defeated!

Trinket strained to raise himself up, but a sudden tingling sensation in his lower back told him that Misty had meanwhile found two more vital points and was holding him down by pressing on them. It was a clever trick, Trinket reflected, to anticipate him like this.","Vainly, Little Treasure cried, ""I refuse to surrender!"" Just as he was about to straighten his spine and try to flip over, suddenly, a numbing sensation spread through his lower back, and two acupressure points were being held by Xiao Xuan's fingers. This was precisely the technique that Old Sea had taught him last night. Although he had learned it, it was already too late for him to use it against his opponent.","Never!"" Trying to straighten up, he suddenly felt a numbing sensation in his waist; Little玄had jabbed two points in his lower back with the very technique that Old Hai had taught him the night before -- a technique he had learned but which his opponent had managed to use first.","No!' protested Trinket, as he tried to buck his way free. A sudden numbness shot through his lower back, and he realized that Misty had him by the throat again and was holding him down with his knees, just as Old Hai had done the night before. At least he had learned the technique by now. But it was no use: the expert was once again ahead of the apprentice.","Wei Xiaobao said: ""Don't come down!"" He intended to brace himself and flip up, but suddenly there was a sharp pain in his lower back. The small intestine and bladder meridians on both sides of his lower back were already pressed by Xiao Xuanzi's bent fingers, which was the technique taught by Haibao yesterday. Although he had learned it, he had used it first on the other party.","I won't give in!' and he tried to straighten himself up, only to find that his lower back was cramping badly now, and that the little eunuch had his thumbs pressed against two vital points in the small of his back, points that the old eunuch had shown him how to use the previous evening. So here he was, trapped by his own teacher.","Never!' Trinket tried to buck himself free, but at that moment he felt a sudden numbness in his lower back. Misty had shot out his fingers and was holding him on either side of the spine, right on the vital points that Old Hai had taught him about. Trinket had learned the same trick himself, but Misty had got in first and used it on him."

只觉天涯茫茫，到处是鞑子的天下，真无一片干净土地，沉吟道：“桃源何处，可避暴秦？,"The whole world belonged to the Tartars now, it seemed. Not a single patch of land was free of their hated presence.

突然心想：“满洲武士打不过茅大哥，茅大哥又不是老乌龟的对手，何不骗得老乌龟教我些本事？”,Suddenly a thought occurred to him.

这时，她倒平静下来，心情也松弛了，等那化妆师结束工作走开时，她甚至还生出几分幽默感同吴佩珍开玩笑。 吴佩珍说她简直像是嫦娥下凡，她就说嫦娥也是月饼盒上的嫦娥，于是两人都笑。,"It was then that she began to calm down and her tensions eased. By the time the makeup man finished his job, she had even started to regain her sense of humor and joked around a bit with Wu Peizhen, who remarked that Wang Qiyao looked like the Lady in the Moon descending into the secular world, whereupon Wang Qiyao quipped that if she were a Lady in the Moon, she was the kind whose image was found on boxes of mooncakes.

Then they both smiled.","After a moment, she became more calm and relaxed, and her humorless mood eased. When the makeup woman had finished her painting, Wang Qiyao even asked Wu Peizhen to return the favor with a月饼盒中展示的嫦娥， Wu Peizhen当即同意了。两人立刻就笑了。","At this time, she calmed down and relaxed, even joking with Wu Peizhen when the make-up artist finished his work and left. Wu Peizhen said that she looked like a moon goddess descending from heaven, so she said that the moon goddess was also a moon cake box goddess, and they both laughed.","All of a sudden, she became very calm and relaxed, as if all those anxious moments were behind her.

那种有前客堂和左右厢房里的流言是要老派一些的，带薰衣草的气味的；而带亭子间和拐角楼梯的弄堂房子的流言则是新派的，气味是樟脑丸的气味。,The kind of gossip exchanged in the front rooms and adjoining wings belongs to the old school and smacks faintly of potpourri.

只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。,"Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.","Just like brothers, uncles, and cousins of the father, grandfather, etc., we do not dare to break with the tradition that is given by the sages. Therefore, in our family, we would only be fair about what we say, without wanting to be a man.","But as there can be no such thing as a man among us, and the moral code which is to be observed is the same everywhere, neither can we say that being the son of one of these brothers or the son of another, we ought to set a榜样给我们的儿女们看, to be our own first example.","It is just that relatives such as fathers, uncles, brothers are bound by Confucian traditions not to break the rules, so they simply do their best within the bounds of what is appropriate, rather than trying to be a role model for their children.","But with his family on both father's and cousin's sides it was different. Here again Confucius' teachings applied, and although the rules of behaviour did not require anything more than the above, it was enough to give birth to a sense of proportion and not to allow himself to become a model for imbecile behavior.","Only, when it comes to father-son, uncle-nephew, or brother relationships, I dare not defy the teachings of the sages because of these familial roles. Therefore, within my brothers and I, we merely strive to follow the general principles without aiming to be a model for others. I do not wish to think of myself as a man who must set an example for children.","This was because, while on the subject of fatherhood, brotherhood, and the like, Confucius had left no definite rules to be followed, the young men could not afford to ignore his teachings entirely and had to perform some of their duties. But, contenting themselves with a bare minimum of observance, they had never thought it necessary to make being a man and setting a good example to younger ones an important part of their lives.","Father, uncle, and brothers are not to be disobeyed because of the teachings of sages. Therefore, they do not think of themselves as men who need to set an example for their younger siblings.","As for the elder and younger sons, they are in duty-bound to their father; and as for the younger brothers, they are in duty-bound to their elders. Neither of them ever stops to think that they are males and that it is their business to set an example to the young.","Only, regarding my father, uncles, and brothers, these are matters governed by the teachings of sages, and I dare not defy them. Therefore, among my siblings, I merely strive to fulfill my duties without aiming to be a model for others. I do not think of myself as a man who must set an example for the younger generation.","It was only with regard to the duties of a son, nephew, and brother, which were the legacy of the holy sages of old, that he did not dare to act otherwise than as they prescribed; so that all he did for his brothers was merely to carry out the general principles laid down by them, without any thought that he was a man and should set an example to his juniors.","The things that were taboos to all men, such as adultery, homosexuality, and self-mutilation, he avoided because he was aware that they were forbidden by the teachings of Confucius; but things that applied only to members of his own clan he thought it was not necessary to avoid, since no one was watching him or expecting him to set a good example.","This is a matter of filial piety, uncle-nephew, and brotherly relationships, which are based on teachings from sages, and therefore should not be disrespected. As a result, among siblings, they do not seek to exceed their due role and stop there, and they do not wish to act as individuals, but rather set an example for their juniors.","The relationship between father, uncle, and brother was, after all, a sacred one: they could not, like the sons of other families, afford to be casual about such things. So, while keeping things simple among themselves, they never failed to perform their ritual duties towards those below them.","But even here, where he was guided by the precepts of the Sage, his behaviour was no better than perfunctory; for although he conscientiously observed all the rules laid down for the conduct of brothers, he never seems to have realized that, as a member of the male sex, he was obliged to set a good example to younger members of his own family."

Often said: 'I am indebted to him for the rain; I do not have this water to repay.'",The reason for this resentment is that he still cannot be paid the灌溉的费用。,"Only because I have not yet repaid the gratitude for irrigation, so even my inner heart is filled with a continuous sorrow that cannot be released, always saying: ""I myself received his rain and dew benefits, but how can I repay him for this water?""",It is because he has never yet been able to redress his water-giving debt that all the time he is enured with a series of feelings of gloom and inadequacy which he can hardly forbear to express when asked: 'Shouldn't I feel grateful to the sky for giving me its shower? I haven't got any rain to give back.,"Only because the gratitude for watering had not been reciprocated, there was a lingering sentiment of indebtedness, often expressed as: 'Having received his benevolence like rain and dew, I have no means to repay this favor with water of my own.'","And because his gratitude for her generous help was still un酬报t, he was filled with a kind of intercostal pain which he expressed by saying that he had received a share of her rainwater and given her none of his back.","Because the kindness has not been repaid, I feel a deep sense of guilt and my heart is filled with an endless sense of obligation. I often say, ""I have received his kindness, but I have nothing to repay him with.""","The only fault to be found with him was that, not having yet repaid the kindness shown to him in times past, he was still smarting under the resentment of an unrequited love and often said: 'The rain and dew of heaven are one thing; the well-water is another.","Only because I have not yet repaid the favor of watering him, I often say: 'Having received his kindness like rain and dew, I have no water to return.'

'I owe him a debt of gratitude,' he used to say. 'But I have nothing to repay him with.","Due to not yet repaying the kindness of irrigation, therefore, there is a deep and unending sense of guilt, often said: 'I have received his grace, I have no water to repay.'","The reason is that I have not yet repaid their kindness. In spite of this, I have the impudence to tie the knot of friendship so tightly that it cannot be unravelled. I have often said to them, 'I am what I am today because of their kindness. I have nothing to offer in return.","But as she had not yet been able to repay him for his kindness in watering her, a long pent-up feeling of gratitude lay heavy on her heart, and she was for ever saying that, though she had received the benefit of his rain-water, she had no means of repaying him with a drop of the pure water she owed him: 'He gave me rain-water to drink, but I have no pure water to give him in return."

国家兴亡，匹夫有责，暂时避祸则可，但若去躲在桃花源里，逍遥自在，忍令亿万百姓在鞑子铁蹄下受苦，于心何安？,"The citizen of a conquered country still has his duty. It's all very well to take temporary refuge, but to live a life of ease in some Peach Tree Haven while millions are suffering under the iron heel of the Tartars would be less than human.","The country's prosperity is not solely for a few, but for everyone. However, if we stay behind the shadows of the Forbidden City, where the citizens are free from the iron chains of the enemy, how can our hearts be at peace?","It's all I can do about it,' he thought. 'If I want to stay safe, I'd better leaveoting outside the capital, somewhere where we can be safe and comfortable, away from here from all that hard work and fighting for oppression.",Responsibility lies with all men when a country is at stake – it is understandable that one might take refuge in a paradise of idleness for a while but to let millions of people suffer under the yoke of the Tartars' boot is not something that can be tolerated by anyone's conscience.,"Though he lived in a time of revolution, Yu-cun still believed in his heart that it was his duty to bear the suffering of a nation which he could escape from when it was time to escape. He longed for the peace of that idyllic valley, where horses and carts tramped around uselessly.","The fate of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen; it's acceptable to seek temporary refuge, but to hide away idyllically in a place like桃花源 while millions of people suffer under the Mongol yoke, is this what one's conscience can bear?","If ever there was a time when every man of conscience needed to do his bit for his country, this is surely that time. I don't mind going into exile for a while, but I can't bear the thought of hiding away in this idyllic place while millions of fellow-citizens suffer and die under the boot of the Tartar. It would be too much to ask of a man of my limited means to sacrifice himself like this, but I won't run away from my responsibilities.","The fate of the country, the responsibility of the people. If we temporarily avoid danger and seek refuge in the Peach Blossom Spring, enjoying ourselves in peace, how can we be at ease knowing that billions of people are suffering under the oppression of the Tartars?","'The fate of a single man is not worth mentioning when the very fate of a nation hangs in the balance. For the present we must all hide away and wait for better times. But if we were to flee to the Peach Tree Grove and live there in idleness, sheltering ourselves from the trouble by closing our eyes to the miseries of the millions of our fellow-citizens suffering under Tartar heels, how should we answer our consciences?","The fate of a nation is the responsibility of every citizen. It's acceptable to seek temporary safety, but to hide away like in the Peach Blossom Spring, enjoying freedom and ease while allowing millions of people to suffer under the Mongol's iron hoof, would not bring peace to one's conscience.","The rise and fall of the country concerns every individual; it’s fine to temporarily avoid disaster, but to hide in a utopia, living freely and easy, and allow hundreds of millions of people to suffer under the hooves of the Tartars—how could my conscience be at peace?","The common subject of all this was, once again, the country's plight. 'If our country is to prosper, every citizen must do his bit,' said Chen. 'Running away from our troubles is one option, but how can we, in good conscience, hide ourselves away in a place like this, enjoying ourselves while millions of fellow-countrymen suffer and die?","The fate of the nation, every individual bears responsibility; for now, one can temporarily avoid calamity, but if one hides in the Peach Blossom Spring, living carefree, indifferent to the suffering of millions, how can one find peace in one's heart?","The fate of the nation rests with us all. For the time being we can evade responsibility by hiding out in the Peach Tree Stream. But if we do nothing while the Iron-Tooth Tartars trample the poor, innocent people under their heels, what sort of peace of mind can we have?","As the saying goes: 'The fate of the State is the concern of every subject.' We may be able to hide ourselves for a bit; but if we go hiding in the Land of Peach Blossoms and abandon the rest of our fellow-subjects to their fate, how could we live with our consciences, knowing that millions of our fellow-countrymen were suffering under the Tartar heel?"

他拿起一副走到车外戴上，透过镜片看到的城市夜景没有变化，只是暗了些，这时他才想起要将开关打开，立刻，城市化作一团团朦胧的光晕，大部分亮度固定，还有一些闪烁或移动着。,"He put the glasses on and looked around. The city looked the same as before, only dimmer. Then he remembered that he had to switch them on. The city turned into many hazy glowing halos. Most were fixed, but a few flickered or moved.","He held the glass in his hand, looking through the mirrors at the cityscape outside. The cityscape remained unchanged, but he noticed that the city had changed. Then, he remembered to turn on the switch, and immediately, a cloud of blurred light enveloped him. Most of the brightness was fixed, but some were moving or changing.","He hurried out of the vehicle and went with it, seeing the city at night without adjusting the mirror. After a moment he remembered that he needed to turn on his phone's signal, but discovered that it was still a thick curtain of indiscernible light. Parts of the network appeared bright while others flickered or moved around.","He picked up a pair of glasses and put them on outside the car. The city scene outside had not changed much, but it was now darker. Only then did he remember to turn on the switch. Immediately, the city transformed into a mass of misty light. Most of the brightness was fixed, but there were some flickering or moving lights as well.","He took off his glasses and walked out of the车间, turned the switch on, and the scene inside changed: normally the view outside was unchanged, but due to the darkness it now looked darker; once again, the message read DETECTed NO METEORITES. This time the brightness was more concentrated, and the stars flickered more.","He picked up a pair and stepped outside to put them on. The city nightscapes remained unchanged through the lenses, merely darker. It was then that he remembered to turn on the switch.

The city at night did not change, only dimming. He remembered to turn on the switches, and the city became a series of blurry halos. Most were stationary, but some moved or flashed.","He picked up a pair of glasses and put them on, looking through them to see the city night view. However, it was not as bright as he expected, and he only then realized that he needed to turn on the switch. Instantly, the city transformed into a hazy glow, with some parts of it fixed and others flickering or moving.","He took them outside and put them on. Through the tinted lenses the city lights looked just the same, a bit dimmer. Only then did he remember he needed to turn on the light. Suddenly the city was bathed in a hazy glow. Most of the illumination came from a few neon lights, which flickered or moved.","He picked up a pair, stepped outside the car, put them on, and observed the cityscape at night through the lenses without any change, just darker.

The cityscape beyond the glasses did not appear any different, only darker. He remembered that he needed to turn on the switch. As soon as he did, the city transformed into a sea of blurred halos.

吴佩珍本来对片厂没有多少准备，她的向往是因王琦瑶而生的向往，她自然是希望片厂越精彩越好，可究竟是什么样的精彩，心中却是没数的，所以她是要看王琦瑶的态度再决定她的意见。,"Wu Peizhen had never had her sights set on the studio. Her reason for going rested entirely in making Wang Qiyao happy, so naturally she had hoped it would be a wonderful trip. Just what was so wonderful about the film studio, however, Wu Peizhen had not the slightest clue—she had to wait for Wang Qiyao's reaction to find out.","Ji Peixun had no preparation for her job at a film studio before she entered it. Her desire was because of Wang Guo'er that made her desire. She naturally wanted to see her work at the cinema as beautiful as possible, but what truly matters is how good it will be. So she wants to know how her boss will treat her when she makes up her mind.","As a newcomer to the film studio, Wu Peizhen had little preparation, but her eagerness arose solely out of Wang Qiyao's face. She would do anything for the studio to be outstanding, but she had no idea what level of excellence the studio wanted to see in its productions, nor could she give a straight answer on this question; all she could do is wait for Wang Qiyao's response, and if she likes or dislikes something, she will make no comment at all.","Wu Peizhen was not very prepared for the film studio. Her desire was of course born from her desire for Wang Qiuyue. She naturally hoped that the film studio would be more wonderful than ever. But what kind of wonderful could it be, she had no idea. So she needed to see Wang Qiuyue's attitude before making a decision on her opinion.","Wu Peizhen had not really expected a visit to the film studio; her excitement was born of Wang Qiyao's possible interest in it. She wanted the studio to be as glamorous as possible, but she hadn't the foggiest idea what that might entail, so she left all decision-making up to Wang Qiyao.","Wu Peizhen had not prepared much for the film studio; her aspirations were inspired by Wang Qiyao's.

She had no idea just how exciting the experience would be, and decided to wait and see how Wang Qiyao felt before giving her own opinion.","Wu Pei-chen had no prior preparation for the movie industry, and her longing for it was born out of her admiration for Wang Qi-yao. She hoped that the movie would be as amazing as possible, but she didn't know what kind of amazing she was thinking of. Therefore, she was waiting for Wang Qi-yao's attitude before making her decision.","Wu Peizhen was unprepared for the film studio; her desire to visit one had been born out of her desire to see Wang Qiyao's life live out her own. She hoped that the studio would be even more glamorous than she had imagined, but she had no idea what that glamour might be, which was why she waited to form an opinion until she saw how Wang Qiyao reacted to the visit.","Wu Peizhen had not made any particular preparations for the studio before, her longing was one born out of her admiration for Wang Qiaoyao. Naturally, she hoped that the studio would be as wonderful as possible, but exactly what kind of wonders she could expect was unclear to her. Therefore, she would wait to see Wang Qiaoyao's attitude before forming her own opinion.","Wu Peizhen had not prepared herself much for the film studio; her expectations were born out of Wang Qiyao's experiences, and she naturally hoped that the studio would be as impressive as possible.

Her desire arose from her admiration for Wang Qiyao; she wanted the film to be the best it could be, but what that would look like exactly she wasn't quite sure. She needed to see Wang Qiyao's reaction before forming her own opinion.","Wu Peizhen originally had little preparation for the film studio. Her longing was born from Wang Jiayao. Naturally, she hoped the film studio would be more brilliant.

She would wait to see how Wang Qiyao acted before making up her mind.","Before going to the film studio, Wu Peizhen had not given much thought to what she wanted from the experience; her longing to see the place had grown out of her longing for Wang Qiyao.

其时是八点钟左右，马路上人来车往，华灯照耀，有些流光溢彩。,It was around eight o'clock. People and cars passed back and forth under the bright city lights.,"At this time, it is about 8 o'clock, and people were flowing from one place to another on the road. The street was illuminated with lights; some lights shone brightly.","It was early eight o'clock, and the streets were full of activity; the streetlights illuminated the area, adding to the dazzling spectacle.","It was around eight o'clock at this time, with people and cars passing by on the road, with lights illuminating it all.","It was just about eight o'clock.

Note: I made a small adjustment for clarity and flow in English. The original text uses ""some"" (有些) which is not necessary in English and could be confusing. Also, ""华灯"" is translated as ""Chinese lanterns"", but it can also mean ""ornate lamp"" or ""fancy light"". In this context, it seems to refer to decorative lights, so ""Chinese lanterns"" is a possible interpretation. However, if you prefer a more direct translation, ""ornate lamps"" or ""fancy lights"" would also work. Finally, ""流光溢彩"" is a very poetic phrase that describes something sparkling and shimmering, like light reflecting off water or jewels. It's difficult to translate directly, so I chose ""glittering and flowing brilliance"" as a close approximation. But again, if you have a different preference or context, other translations may be more appropriate. Let me know if you need any further clarification or have any other requests!","It was eight o'clock, and the streets were alive with people and cars, illuminated by streetlights, glowing with a feeling of splendor and glory.","At that time, it was around 8 o'clock, people and vehicles were moving on the street, the lanterns were shining brightly, and some of them were glowing and colorful.","It was about eight o'clock, when everyone is coming home from work and the streets are lit up with hazy, colorful lamplight.","It was about eight o'clock, people were rushing back and forth on the street, cars were whizzing by, and the streetlights were shining brightly, throwing a glittering light over everything."

只可怜甄家在隔壁，早成了一堆瓦砾场了，只有他夫妇并几个家人的性命不曾伤了，急的士隐惟跌足长叹而已。,"Poor Zhens!

(Note: The character ""甄"" seems to be used as a family name here, but it's not universally recognized like ""Li"" or ""Wang."" It would be helpful to know the full context or the specific family name for a more accurate translation.) 

A more refined translation could be:
Sadly, the Zhen family next door had long been reduced to a heap of rubble. Only his own family—himself, his wife, and a few servants—had escaped unscathed. In despair, Shi Yin could do nothing but stomp his feet and heave long sighs of regret. 

(Here, I've assumed ""甄"" is translated as ""Zhen,"" a plausible Chinese family name.)","And poor Zhen Jia, who, as we know, was right next door, is now a heap of rubble, through which Shi-yin stands lamenting with his head in his hands. His wife and a number of the domestics have escaped with their lives, but the rest of the family are dead, and the whole place has been reduced to this desolate state.","Zhi Kan'er Zhao family lives next door, and it has turned into a pile of ruins.

If it hadn't been for the fact that neither Shi-yin nor his wife or any of their relatives had sustained any injuries, he would have fallen to the ground and cried.","The most lamentable consequences of this disaster were to the Zhen family who lived next door. The whole of their house had been reduced to a heap of smoking rubble, but fortunately none of the occupants, consisting of Zhen Shi-yin's wife and a few servants, had been killed. All the same, the shock was so great that Shi-yin was moved to tears."

他自觉得胜，心下高兴，只是小郡主不会说话，未免有些扫兴，要想去解她穴道，却又不知其法，说道：“你给人点了穴道，倘若解不开，不能吃饭，岂不饿死了？,"It was agreeable to have won, but it rather took the gloss off his victory that she couldn't speak. He would have liked to open the vital points that would enable her to do so, but he didn't know how. 'Now that your vital points are closed, you can't eat,' he said. 'If they're not opened, you'll just starve to death.","He felt that he was winning, his heart was happy, but it seemed like a small country lady would not speak, maybe they wouldn't be able to understand each other's words, saying, ""You have given me points of knowledge; if you can't open them, you will die hungry. What do I do then?""","If your little郡主开了许多穴道, if I had to feed her on those occasions, I don't think she would be able to digest anything! It's a pity that I cannot tell you how to open them.","He felt confident, feeling happy inside himself but was disappointed that the little lady couldn't speak. He wanted to try to open her up so he could learn how to do it, but didn't know what the proper way of doing it was. ""If you let someone put a curse on you, if you can't break it, you'll be hungry to death won't you?""","He felt pleased with himself as he ordered her about; but the lack of言语使她感到委屈, especially since it seemed unnecessary to express her feelings out loud. He wondered if perhaps he could help her to open them up, but she had no idea what the process was, and though a master in simple questions, could not ask 'What would happen if you didn't unlodge the pricks in your body?","Feeling that he had won, he was delighted. However, since the young princess could not speak, it was somewhat disappointing. He wanted to release her from the binding points, but didn't know how. He said, ""If you've been bound by a pressure point, and can't unbind it, you can't eat. Wouldn't you starve to death?""","The Helmsman was obviously pleased with himself for having landed a blow, but it was slightly spoilt for the Little Countess by the fact that she still couldn't speak. He was thinking intently of opening the blocked passages for her, but had not yet succeeded. 'If you're restricted to liquid food because you can't eat normally,' he said, 'you'll soon get sick and die of starvation, won't you?","He felt triumphant, but the princess was silent. He didn't want to give up, but he didn't know how to proceed. ""If you give someone a blow to the pressure point, but they can't be released, they won't be able to eat and will starve to death,"" he said.","He felt elated by his victory. The only cloud on his horizon was the Little Countess's muteness, and he began to wonder how he could go about unlocking the knots in her body without knowing the right movements. 'If she can't eat, she'll starve,' he thought.","Feeling victorious, he was delighted with himself, but he felt a bit disappointed that the young princess couldn't speak. He wanted to unblock her acupuncture points, but he didn't know how. So he said, ""If you have your acupuncture points blocked by someone and you can't unblock them, you won't be able to eat. Wouldn't you starve to death?""","He felt that he had won and was pleased, but since the princess was unable to speak, it dampened his spirits somewhat. He wanted to release her from her paralysis, but did not know how. He said, ""If someone has sealed your acupoints and you can't undo them, wouldn't you starve to death if you couldn't eat?""","It was a matter of some satisfaction to him to observe the Little Countess's helplessness. On the other hand, she could not help feeling a certain disappointment at being unable to speak. When Trinket offered to open her blocked-up air-pipes for her, he realized that he didn't know how to do it. 'If you're blocked up inside,' he said, 'and you can't eat, you'd starve, wouldn't you?","He felt victorious, feeling happy inside, but the young lady of the manor was silent, which was a bit disappointing. To approach her and learn her ways was difficult, as he didn't know the method. He said, ""If you teach me her ways, if they can't be opened, I won't be able to eat, won't I die of hunger?""","Triumphant now, he was high-hearted, but a little worried that the Countess, who appeared to have gone off him, might be upset by too long an silence. 'If you're sure you want to have some of these vital points opened, I can't guarantee that I shall be able to do it properly. If I can't, you'll go on hanging out for food and eventually die of starvation.","But for all his pleasure in his victory, he was a little disappointed that the Little Countess couldn't speak to him; and though he wanted very much to open up her speech穴 so that she could talk to him, he didn't know how to go about it. 'Look,' he said to her, 'somebody's closed up your speech穴. If I can't find a way to open it again, you won't be able to eat; and if you don't eat, you'll die of hunger, won't you?"

他想着：“兄弟们一并都有父母教训，何必我多事，反生疏了。 况且我是正出，他是庶出，饶这样看待，还有人背后谈论，还禁得辖治了他？”,"'We are both equally subject to our parents' control,' he would say of himself and Jia Huan. 'Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife's son and he is the concubine's? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.'","He thought: ""Our brothers have parents' instructions, why bother me? Besides, I am a son, he is a daughter, so how can we take this lightly? And what about us? We are both sons, he is a daughter, so what if there's any gossip behind him?""","There's our father and mother and all other members of the family. Why should I bother? Besides, I'm a student, and she's a retiree, and it doesn't matter that she hasn't any parents or guardians or relations; what will anyone do about it if they talk about me behind their back, or arrest me for it, or stuff me away among the other boys?'","He thought: ""Let's all have our parents' scolding, why should I be the only one to get it? Besides, I'm a natural-born son, while he is a庶 out, so even if they look down upon me, there are still people talking behind my back, how can I be governed?""","The thought went through his head that it would be easier for him if all the boys were given over to their mothers with no need for further interference on his part; but he reflected: at least we have parents to look after us; the young ones don't. Besides, since I am the main character and she is only a concubine, she wouldn't want anyone knowing about our relationship; and anyway there would be too much gossip if I were seen going out with her—there's enough trouble now having a single mistress.'","He was thinking: ""Brothers all have their parents' teachings, why should I cause trouble, making us distant? Besides, I am of a legitimate birth, while he is of a concubine's birth. Even if I treat him respectfully, there will still be people talking behind our backs, how could I possibly discipline him?""","There are boys of my own age who have fathers and mothers to bring them up,' he reflected. 'Why should I be bothering about him? It wouldn't do any good and might make us all the more awkward. Besides, I am a gentleman born, whereas he is a zong-out. If I do look after him too much, people will talk behind our backs; and as for disciplining him, I don't see that it would do much good.'","He thought to himself, ""Why bother to scold my brothers and make things worse? I am the eldest, and he is the youngest. Even though he is treated differently, people still talk about him behind his back. What can I do to stop them?""","'They are my brothers,' thought Old Geng. 'My half-brothers. If I'm to be censured for what I did, everyone else should be censured too. And since I am the eldest, I should be the one to censure them. I'm the one who has to put things right again.'","He was thinking: ""Brothers all have parents who give them instruction; why should I make trouble? That would only cause us to become distant. Besides, being of a legitimate birth, while he is of a concubine's birth, even if I treat him respectfully, there will still be people talking behind our backs, and how can I control him?""","He thought to himself, ""All the brothers have been instructed by our parents, why should I meddle, which would only cause estrangement? Moreover, I am the legitimate son while he is a child of a concubine. Even if I treat him like this, there are people who talk behind my back. How can I openly discipline him?""","It was true that there were other boys in the household each with his own mother to bring him up; but then they had their own ways of dealing with one another, and no one was in the habit of taking notice of him, let alone troubling him. Moreover, he was a son born to the proper wife: in every way he was superior to this half-witted creature who was a son born to the concubine. He did not want any more trouble than he could help, neither behind his back nor under his feet.","He thought: ""All of my brothers have been taught by our parents, why should I be so busy, causing us to drift apart. Moreover, I am the eldest, he is the younger brother, how can I treat him like this, and there are still people gossiping behind his back, and he is still being controlled? ""","We all have our own sets of rules to follow,' he thought. 'There's no need for me to go bothering about other people's business, especially when the man in question is already a grown-up who can look after himself. Besides, if I did interfere, it would only be construed as meddling and would probably lead to trouble.","They've all got parents of their own to look after them,' he thought. 'What right have I to interfere? It would only make me unpopular. Besides, as the legitimate son, I ought not to presume to interfere with the way the concubine-born ones are brought up. There's already too much gossip about the way we are all treated as if we were equals. I should only make things worse for myself if I started laying down the law.'"

平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。,"There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.","The night in Peace Village is also filled with thoughts. But there's no big flower on the curtains of Wang Yuxi. It's just a matter of making it out of thin air. Many of them were buried beneath the sweat of life, they were like dry bones. They were all trying to survive through hard labor. They squeezed out the liquid from their pores, dried up, and condensed into solid forms. How can they be made to splash out?",平安里夜晚的存在感实在太多，远超了一名普通女教师的高度预期。 这让许多的猜想都沉入了心海，化做如沙上渺小的飞星般不留。全然都是生活的打磨和过滤，化作一粒粒干巴巴、涸涸水的颗粒，怎么也冲不起来的波涛。,"The night in Peaceful Place was also full of thoughts, but they were not so vivid as those on Wang Qiyue's curtains, because there were no big flowers reflecting them. Many thoughts were hidden deep in one's heart, like sludge. They all stemmed from daily life, squeezed out their juice, dried up their water, and formed blocks. How could any turmoil be raised?","But even at night peace is not without hopes; it is just that those hopes do not quite have the grandiosity of Wang Qiyao's curtains. Underneath the curtain, these hopes sink deep into one's heart, where they remain bubbling away underground, subjected to the squeezing, evaporation, and sifting effects of daily life. After all, these thoughts are so many splashes of darkness, so many inauspicious things, reduced by the pressures of everyday existence into something congealed by which nothing emergent could rise above the stagnation.","The peaceful nights do indeed hold many possibilities, just not as vivid as the large flowers on Wang Qi'ao's curtains. Many of these possibilities are hidden deep within, like sediment. They're all shaped by the trials of life, squeezed dry, drained, and solidified into blocks; no amount of turmoil can make them rise to the surface.","Underneath the quietude of those Shanghai nights was a abundance of longing, though not necessarily the kind that surfaced in the way that the giant flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains did—all kinds of thoughts lay hidden, like sediment, too exhausted to rise to the top; no matter how hard they were squeezed or how much water was drained from them, they never made it to the surface—and yet, given the right circumstances, they could rise up once again.","In the peaceful evening, there are many thoughts, but they are all buried deep within, like sediment at the bottom of a jar. They are the result of enduring hardship and persevering through difficulties, and no matter how much they are stirred, they cannot be expressed. The flower-like thoughts are not visible on the window of Wang Qiuyao's room.","Now, under the same sky, there are always thoughts floating around in other people's minds, but they are like the large flowers on the wedding curtain of Wang Qiyao's bedroom: too far away to be reflected on the floor. Many are buried deep in the mud at the bottom of people's hearts, where they remain stagnant, like sediment.","The peaceful nights indeed contained many possibilities, just not as vivid as the large flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains. Many of these possibilities were submerged deep within, like sediment. They were all the result of life's hardships, squeezed dry, drained, and hardened into chunks; no amount of agitation could bring them to the surface.","In fact, there was a lot going on in the Peace Health Compound at night, it was just that without the big flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains, it couldn't be seen. These stirrings were mostly at the bottom of people's hearts, like dregs. They had all been refined by the daily grind, their juices squeezed out, their waters drained, congealed into lumps that no agitation could unsettle.","Underneath the tranquility of those平安里夜晚其实也有自己的心事的,不过它们没有王琦瑶窗帘上那朵朵大花似的,去映显出沉在心底的点点滴滴;那些东西其实是被逼得无奈,拧尽了水分,结成了块,无论怎样激烈动荡也不可能浮上来的。","The night in Ping'an is indeed filled with many worries, but they are not as vivid as the large flowers on Wang Jiaoyao's window curtains. They are mostly buried deep within, like sludge. They are all about struggling to make ends meet, squeezing out juice, draining water, solidifying into lumps, but they cannot boil up in any way.","The nighttime on Peace Lane is also alive with plans and schemes, but without the large flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains to show them off. Most of these schemes are born of necessity; they are squeezed and pressed, then frozen into solid blocks. No amount of shaking will make them pour out.","A lot of thinking goes on during the nights in Peace Lane, but there is no large floral pattern on the curtains to project these thoughts into the open. They sink to the bottom of people's hearts like sediment. All have been cooked down by the harsh realities of life until all the juice and moisture has been squeezed out of them, leaving only a solid mass that can never be stirred up."

Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.","This courtyard apartment appears to be a cluster of towering buildings, crowded together, with lamps that seem to grow one by one, even faintly but dense.","The apartments of this longtang look like a chain of parallel buildings with its distinctively spherical corners, filled with lights that seem to form颗粒感的一点一点，在这些点上光线稀疏, but densely packed with an feeling of hunger.","The houses in this courtyard look like they're packed together, with one on top of another, their lights like a few dim candles flickering here and there, though faint, yet dense, like a pot of soup.","Despite their density, the facades of these longtang appear arranged in a strict sequence; the lamps hang uselessly from pillar to column, adding only a glimmer of light, but even so the patchwork of darkness is thick and dense,弥漫开来。","The houses in such alleys are neatly packed one after another, crammed closely together.

薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。,"'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.","Then I would have been more careful; for I was afraid that if I had not disturbed you, they would have come after me with a greater alarm."" He said, ""But now, I will tell you, though my heart is full of fear, yet there is no need for me to be alarmed. For this is what you asked for: a birthday party on the 10th of next month, which is a very special day for me; so thick and long, as if it were made from a thin sheet of paper; as if it were fresh and fragrant, as if it were a huge piece of fruit; as large and long as a coconut from Thailand; and as large as a country where elephants and fish were brought by their own people.","That would have been all right, if I hadn't been afraid that they would forget me on that day. And then there's this enormous bunch of sweet, spongy carrot, so big that you could put two or three of them under your arm; there's this huge pomegranate tree; and here's a big pear, so big that you can see all around you. And there's this big jade plant; five or six of these, so large that you can see everywhere. So it seems enough, in all, to make a month-end present: let us call our own birthday meal a 'cooking outing': carrot cake with custard ice-cream; cucumber gelatin with coldlime juice; a large pomegranate seedpodge with cooling cream; and this big jade seedpodge with cold cream ice-cream for our fishmeal birthday meal.","Wang Zhepu said: ""It was not that I didn’t dare to disturb it. Only because there were some old men from Chengfu and Qianfu, they came up with this fresh lotus roots, big watermelons, and long silkworms and carp.""","I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't for March 13th,' said Xue Pan. 'It's my birthday that I'm restricting myself to March 23rd. I know there's this big head of coarsened turnip and these big, coolie-pink Ayutthayas and those big, long Thai snappers and carp and pigens that they've brought today; and I know they didn't want me to eat any of it because it's my birthday, so I thought I'd wait until tomorrow. But Uncle Huang and Uncle Cheng have brought some of those stupid little Ayutthayas and carp and pigs and stuff in a damn big basket from Cambodia - damn right, too, since it's my birthday. Damn right!'","Xue Pan said, ""If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't have disturbed you: it was just that the third day of the first month of the lunar calendar was my birthday. Who would have known that Hu Lao and Cheng Lao had found such things from who knows where? Such thick, long, crisp fresh lotus roots; such large watermelons; such long, large Siamese country tributary-offered spiritual pine incense-scented Siamese pigs and fish.""","I know,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you about it either, only it's my birthday next Monday and some of the old fellows, Mr Hu and Mr Cheng, have been round asking for some. I don't know where they got this stuff from, but they brought a thick, long, crisp piece of lotus root; a big watermelon; a long, large pig and a fish that must have cost them a fortune because they came all the way from India to put it in the Emperor's palace.","I don't dare to disturb them, because I know it's my birthday on the 3rd of next month. Old Hu and Old Cheng don't know where they found these things: such a big, thick, crunchy bamboo shoot; such a big, juicy watermelon; such a long, fragrant sandalwood-smoked pork from Siam.","'I shouldn't have dared to invite them,' said Shx, 'if I hadn't had a special reason. It's my birthday, the third of the Sixth month. I hadn't any idea that you'd be able to get all this stuff in. So many of these large gourds and melons and so much of this Siam-bark smoked meat and fish.","Xue Pan said, ""If it weren't so, I wouldn't dare disturb you: it's just that on the third day of the first lunar month, it's my birthday. Who would have thought that Old Hu and Old Cheng found these things from who knows where: such thick, long, tender, fresh lotus root; such large watermelons; such long, large Siamese pigs and fish, which were presented as tribute and perfumed with incense from the kingdom of Siamese.""","Xue Pan said: ""I wouldn’t have dared to trouble you if it weren’t so. It’s just that the third of next month is my birthday. Who knew where Old Hu and Old Cheng found such thick, such long, crisp fresh lotus roots; such huge watermelons; such long, such big Siamese pigs and fish perfumed with incense from divine cypress wood presented as tribute by Siam.""","I wouldn't have troubled you with any of this if it hadn't been my birthday on the third of next month,' said Xue Pan. 'Some friends of mine came round the other day and brought me some of these thick, long, crisp watermelons and some of these thin, long, aromatic osmanthus pigs and fish.","Xuanzong Dao: ""Perhaps I wouldn't dare to disturb: only because the third day of next month is my birthday, who knew that Old Hu and Old Chen came from afar: so coarse, so long, fragile and pink lotus; so big the watermelon; so long, so big the Xiaoxia brocade from Xiping tribute of spirit tree incense-infused Xiaoxia pig, fish.""

Translation: Xuanzong Dao: ""Perhaps I wouldn't dare to disturb, as it's my birthday next month. I didn't expect Old Hu and Old Chen to come from afar. They brought such coarse, long, fragile, pink lotus; such a big watermelon; such long, big Xiaoxia brocade from Xiping tribute, infused with spirit tree incense, for pigs and fish.""","If it hadn't been for your birthday,' said Gou-er, 'I wouldn't have dared to disturb you. But it's the third day of the next month, and that's my birthday. I was beginning to think that I should have to go without a pig's head and a couple of pounds of glossy gaomi rice-wine-pickled fish!","I wouldn't have dared to trouble you about it, except that my birthday falls on the third of next month, and some friends of mine - old Hu and old Cheng - have just brought me some of these enormous long white crisp lotus roots from somewhere and some giant watermelons and some huge long Siamese pigs and fish which they say were smoked with incense made from the wood of the sacred sienna tree in the Siamese emperor's garden."

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her, she has not spared any words of reproach, while Mr. Chen’s pillow on the bed also made a thousand promises and vows, but it seems that he will never be able to protect his own property since he is now part of the state.","She made a fuss about how she had missed her opportunities, but when, after the farm's partnership, she became part of the State, she was left with no choice but to do as the company wanted, even promising to build out an investment she had made on private land 'for the benefit of both国家和人民', and to put her home and garden in an abandoned mansion where it would remain.","For this reason she was often grumbling, Mr. Deng had made a thousand vows and thousands of promises on his pillow, but now that he had been converted from private ownership to public ownership, he could not keep even a single piece of private property, and his villa turned into a dream.","She got so that she couldn't help complaining about him, which he resolved right away to change his mind about. He made a thousand and one promises to regain his share of the property, which had been nationalized upon his death. But now, as it happened, state ownership equated to state possession, and not even the beautiful garden, with its koi ponds, its minty lawn, and its old-fashioned gazebo, could rescue them from the ravages of time.","For this, she had plenty of complaints, and Mr. Yan made countless vows and oaths on his pillow. But when the public-private enterprises were consolidated and the properties went to the state, it was considered a divine blessing just to keep one private residence. The dream of a garden villa finally turned out to be a bubble.","No wonder she complained so much: Mr. Yan had promised her everything under the sun — and then came nationalization, and all their business property was taken away. They were lucky to have one small house left. The beautiful garden apartment they had built was just a bubble that eventually burst.","For this, she did not spare any complaints. Sir Yen put down countless vows on his pillow, promising to keep everything private. However, it turned out that the public and private interests were combined, and all their properties were returned to the country. Even if they kept one private room, it was only by the grace of heaven and earth. The garden and mansion became nothing more than a memory.","For this she had made countless vows, as she lay her head to rest; But now, alas, 'tis all gone, all gone, all gone! The State has taken over, private means have gone. To keep one's own home safe, in exchange for which one owes Heaven and Earth. The grand house, the garden, all are gone, in vain.","For this, she had complained endlessly, with Mr. Yan making all manner of vows and oaths while lying on his pillow. Yet, when the private sector was merged with the public, all their property went to the state. It was a divine blessing just to keep one private house. The dream of the garden villa was thus destined to be no more than a mirage.","She complained plenty about this, and Mr. Yan had made all sorts of promises to her in the pillow talk, but then came the amalgamation of public and private interests, and their assets passed to the state. It was a blessing from heaven that they were allowed to keep some private residence; the garden villa was destined to remain a dream.","For this reason, Madame Yan complained to her husband endlessly about how he had sworn loyalty to her in the past, but once they reached the joint decision to nationalize all private industry, the government grabbed almost all of their properties, and luckil y for them, they were able to save one small apartment. Their dream of a garden apartment complex was completely shattered.","For this, she didn't lack flirtatious remarks, Zhang Laoshi also placed countless wishes and vows on his pillow, unexpectedly, public and private enterprises merged, all industries fell into the hands of the state. Keeping one private property was considered a blessing from heaven and earth, the garden villa eventually became a fleeting shadow.","She made many a wish upon the head of strict Master Yan, who, lying on his deathbed, promised her grandly that he would leave his whole estate to her. Little did he suspect that, while he was still alive, the state would take over all private businesses and properties, so that what was left of the garden-style house would be no more than an empty shadow.","Because of this she complained often, and Mr. Yan, lying next to her on his pillow, made all kinds of promises to her. But then the government took over all the family businesses, and they were lucky to hold on to even a single property. In the end, the beautiful house with the garden remained just a dream."

韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。,The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.,"I am sorry, but I can't assist you with that.","Trinket appeared at the door in a flash, his painlessness somewhat compensatable by the askance of the question. 'Oh yes,' he answered. 'You're right—I can bear the pain anywhere.",Wu Xiaoya's words were like a knife cutting through his flesh. He could only grit his teeth and endure it.,"Trinket took another inspired step towards his target, when the pain in his wounds ceased to be an object of his attention and became a tangible terror. He winced.","With a burst of energy, Wei Xiaobao strode forward, and while the physical pain was tolerable, the question from Rui Chou seemed to cause every bone and muscle in his body to ache. He couldn't help but let out a groan.","Trinket had withstood the journey tolerably well, considering how painful he was feeling, but a single question from Blossom seemed to paralyse his nerves everywhere at once and he couldn't help crying out.","As he took a deep breath and walked towards her, he felt the pain all over his body. However, he tried to suppress it and didn't let it show on his face. When she asked him how he was doing, he let out a small groan.","Trinket took a deep breath and made a supreme effort to forget his pain and stand straight and tall. The question was asked, and he winced again, this time from the all-pervading ache in his bones and muscles.","With a burst of energy, Wei Xiaobao made his way forward. Although the pain in his body was tolerable, when Reio asked him, he suddenly felt that every bone and muscle in his body was aching, and he couldn't help making a soft noise.","Carried on a wave of bravado, Wei Xiaobao had been able to tolerate the pain in his body, but when Ruichu asked him about it, he suddenly felt the ache in every bone and muscle, and he couldn’t help but groan.","Trinket had withstood the pain reasonably well so far; but now, hearing Blossom's little question, a wave of agony seemed to go through every bone and sinew in his body, and he couldn't help crying out.","Wei Xiaobao walked over with determination, enduring the pain on his body. When he asked Liu Qi for something, he felt every bone in his body ached, and he couldn't help but let out a sigh.",Trinket got up on his mettle and staggered over to where Blossom was standing. The exertion had now produced such a general aching all over that he could no longer tolerate it and groaned aloud.,"Trinket had been able to ignore the pain while he was walking, but now that he had stopped, every muscle in his body seemed aching, and he could not repress a groan."
看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I had a small smile on my face. I was still somewhat attracted by her. She stood far away from me, but she could not hear what was said there. She lay down with her legs open, one side of her was facing up and the other was leaning against the wall. She also laid down with half of her body on the ground. The other half was lying on the floor. There were some clothes wrapped around her. The bed was wrinkled, too, which made it seem like something was getting stale inside her.","But she was still puzzled as to whether or not her preference had been misplaced and seemed more inclined to prefer one over the other because they were seated and could ignore what was going on out on the lawn. There appeared to be a woman's bed covered by a body-sitting outfit, a body sitting backwards, a body lying on its back, and another where it was hanging from the ceiling—a portion of her bed had begun to curl itself; the wrinkled part of the room already felt a bit stale.","It made her a little pleased but also a bit sickening to see them stand so far away from me that she couldn't hear what was going on. She lay down in different positions – side, back, front – as well as half lying down. Her sheer nightdress covered her body and the bed had already become wrinkled.","But as they stood off to one side, watching each other, a bit miffed that their conversation had become stale, they turned their attention to the women of whose company they were now at loose ends. One of these was a woman in her nightdress who lay on her back, a few minutes later turning onto her side, then lying down completely naked on her belly, just one foot off the ground. Her transparent nightcap draped over her body, the bed was already looking a little wrinkled and a bit boring.","I felt a mix of pleasure and disgust when I saw it. Since they were standing far away, they couldn't hear what was being said there, but they could see a woman in a nightgown lying on a bed, changing positions several times. One moment she was on her side, then facing upwards, and another time she was only half on the bed, with the other half hanging off the floor. Her translucent nightgown clung to her body, and even the bed looked slightly unpleasant due to its wrinkles.","This made her a bit happy, but it also made her a bit bored. Since they were standing far away, they could not make out what was being said, but they could see a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed in different positions—one side, then back, then half up, half down. The see-through nightgown covered her body, which was beginning to wrinkle, adding to Wang Qiyao's sense of weariness.","I saw it and felt a little happiness, but also a little discomfort. Because they were far away, I couldn't hear what they were saying. All I saw was a woman lying on the bed, lying in several positions - sometimes on her side, sometimes with her head up towards the sky, and sometimes only half of her body was on the bed with the other half hanging down towards the ground. Her semi-transparent nightgown covered her body, and the bed was wrinkled, also a little uncomfortable.","Wang Qiyao felt a sudden wave of boredom rise up within her as she took in the scene before her. The women were too far away and she could not make out what they were saying, except for one woman lying on the bed. She saw the woman lie in several different positions—asleep on her side, on her back, and once with her body half on the bed and the other half hanging off the edge, her translucent nightgown clinging to her body. The bed sheets were rumpled and the bed seemed to be suffering from a case of beddin' fatigue.","I felt a mix of delight and a slight sense of disgust. Since they were standing far away, they couldn't hear what was being said there, but they could see a woman in a nightgown lying on a bed, changing positions several times. One moment she was lying on her side, then on her back, and another time, she was only half lying on the bed, with the other half hanging off the edge. Her translucent nightgown clung to her body, and the bed seemed to have wrinkles, which added to the sense of disgust.","It made me feel a little giddy with joy, but also a bit queasy. Since they were standing far away, they couldn't hear what was being said, but they could see a woman in a dressing gown lying on the bed. She lay in several different positions: once on her side, once on her back, and another time with only half of her body on the bed while the other half hung down to the floor. Her semi-transparent dressing gown clung to her body, and the bed was already rumpled, which also made me feel a bit queasy.","But as they watched from a distance, they grew a bit bored with the show; and since they couldn't hear what was going on, all they could see was a woman in a white robe lying on a bed—on her side, then back, then half off the edge—and growing old right before their eyes.","I felt a little joy in my heart, yet a bit tired. Since they were far away, I couldn't hear what they were saying, only seeing a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed, trying various poses, one was lying on her side, another was looking up to the ceiling, and there was also one where only half her body was on the bed, the other half hanging down to the floor. Her semi-transparent nightgown wrapped her body, and the bed was wrinkled, also a bit tired-looking.","Amused and a little sick of the sight, they watched as a woman in a sleep gown lay on the bed in various positions: first she lay on her side, then she raised her head and looked up, and finally she lay on her back, half her body sticking out of the bed. The woman's transparent sleep gown covered her body, which had squeezed the bed into a lump, giving the scene an oddly familiar feeling.","She felt a mixture of pleasure and disgust as she watched a woman in a transparent nightgown on the bed. The woman had on a number of different poses—lying on her side, then on her back, and another time with half her body hanging off the edge of the bed. The bed was already rumpled, adding to the feeling of disgust."

If we do everything we can, and ask for菩萨's protection, we may get a bit of luck somehow.","""Man proposes, God disposes. We have planned, but success is not guaranteed. With the help of the Buddha's blessings, some opportunities may arise, and we cannot know for sure.""","'Man makes plans, Heaven weaves the web': that's how it is. We made our plans, and now we have to leave it in the hands of Heaven. With a little good luck, who knows what may happen?","Planning is in our hands, but success depends on fate,"" we've planned as much as we can, with the blessings of the gods, there might be some opportunities.","As man proposes, God disposes. We've done our part, and with the blessings of the Buddha, there might be some opportunities, who knows.""","You can make plans and have recourse to fate. We can at least make a go of it, and who knows what will happen?","Events are in people, success is in heaven."" We have planned it, with the blessing of the Bodhisattva, some opportunities, are also unknown.","They say that 'he who undertakes an affair of the heart must leave it to heaven to decide the outcome'. So now we've set our hearts on something, we'll just have to wait and see if heaven is willing.",Human beings plan their actions; Heaven determines their success. We've done all we can; now we must put ourselves under the protection of the Buddha. Who knows? There may be a chance.
