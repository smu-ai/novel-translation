虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother was already a high-crop farmer's daughter in the spirit of harmony with him in the solemn period where he had been born on the half-burdened and half-pleasure of his life, even though she had also given birth to my guilt and righteousness, but that was still a son-in-law from the prosperous Eastman clan generation of the Qing dynasty, who was indeed fatherless and single motherhood at that time, yet I did not know how much her father was attached to me, so when I wrote about those things then, I called him ""Remi"" more accurately than ""Liu Qiuxin"".","Even though she was now pregnant, Grandma had been high schooler at the time. Since that moment she had entered into a love affair with my crime, both tragic and gloriously extravagant. For that matter, she had been the bride of the Zhang family, the maiden-in-waitting of my marriage, and therefore, since my father had not yet set foot on land, we called her Remi's little girl. More importantly than that, the topic of discussion about those days was never referred to as Yu Zhan'ao: it remained purely arbitrary. And finally, even my father, who had not yet left the fork of the mountain, could hardly be called随意的，因为他的存在只能从外人看来。","Although my grandmother was at peace with him among the millet fields, in that solemn process of cohabitation marked by pain and happiness, although she was also carrying half a load of my sins and virtues, after all, she was still the father of the Fengjia County, the noble bride of the Northern Plains, but then, my grandmother was only the single housewife who was married by arrangement; her husband and she were more or less free and accidental. Moreover, my father hadn't yet fallen into the ground, so when I wrote about those events, I still called him Yu Quanliao more accurately.","Even though Great-Grandma had consummated her love for Father in the sorghum field, and although she had, with half pain, half pleasure, become a clear-cut marriage partner of the single Wang clan head, it was still Father who fathered my current existence, even though he hadn't quite lost his footing in society. So when I came to write about this time in his life, I continued to refer to him as Yu Zhan'ao. He was still a very effective name.","Although my grandmother had already achieved harmony with him in the millet field, a process that was a mix of pain and happiness, during which she also conceived my father who embodies both virtues and vices, she was still the legitimate wife of the respected father figure from Gaomai's Northeast Township at that time. Grandfather and she were married in a traditional Chinese ceremony, yet their union carried a certain level of unpredictability and instability. Moreover, my father had not yet been buried, so when it comes to recounting those events, referring to him as Yu Zhanao is more precise.","Although Grandma had already enjoyed a consummated union with Father Guan under the sorghum, in which she had conceived me, her biological link to the next generation, she was still the legally married wife of Mengyang Song, and their union, taking place in the natural environment of song and流水, had been entirely arbitrary, lacking in direction and stability. My father still hadn't been buried, so when it came to writing about that time, it was more accurate to refer to him as Yu Zhan'ao.","Although my grandmother had a tumultuous relationship with my grandfather, and although she was also partly responsible for the troubles that ensued, she was still considered the wife of a respected man from the village. My grandfather and she had a rather unstable and unpredictable relationship, as they were not married in the traditional sense. Moreover, my father had fallen on hard times, so it is more accurate to refer to him as ""Yu Zhan"" when discussing this period of time.</s>","Even though Grandma had flown to the high cornfields in the company of a man who was half the cause of her suffering and half the cause of her happiness, a man who, as the son of a wealthy man from Northeast Gaomi Township, was in any case a local nobleman, she was, at the time, a married woman whose union had been arranged by her parents; and since Granddad was a poor man, his relationship with her was more the casual and tenuous kind that you might call adulterous. So, when the time came to write about those days, 'Yu Zhan' was the more appropriate name for him.","Although my grandmother was already in harmony with him in the millet field, in that solemn process half of pain and half of happiness, my grandmother, although she bore some of my guilt, was still a refined father from a high-ranking family in northeastern China. However, my grandmother was a single woman who was officially married to my grandfather. My grandfather and she were more like a match made in heaven, with a certain degree of casualness, randomness, and instability. Moreover, my father had not settled down, so I still referred to him as Yue Ou Chi at that time, which was more accurate.","Even though my grandma had become one with the phoenix in the sorghum field, and the marriage between my granddad and her was a mixed blessing of pain and happiness, my father, son of a northeastern black-buck ram, was only adopted into the Shan family, so that by that time he was still considered a guest. Moreover, he hadn't yet fathered a child, so calling him Yu Zhan'ao seemed more accurate."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was delighted: ""Yes, a lot of people would rather not pay for the dung on their right cheeks than to carve a pig, which is much more tasty but also smarter.""","Good!' he said. 'From left to right, the face says cattle. No one's going to spend money on a buffalo to etch a 'horse' with. I think, then, that we'd better start selling chicken skins instead.'","He was very pleased and said, ""Hmm, I'll carve some dung on the right side of my face. No one will pay for it because they don't want to buy dung. Why not carve a pig? It's fat and stupid. I'm sure that will be a good business.""","That'll show them!' he said, as he set about刻着一排牛粪。 'A pig, fatter and bigger than anything you've ever seen! That's sure to do me more business than a cow.'","He was quite pleased with himself, saying, ""Well, a face carved with a pile of cow dung is interesting, but no one would pay for cow dung. Instead, carve a pig, which is both fat and foolish. Business would surely be good.""","He was obviously pleased with his handiwork. 'Mm, a cow's dung ball on the right cheek would not be very popular as a souvenir. Better carve something people could actually take home with them. A pig, for instance. Fat and stupid. That should do very well.'","He said, ""Yes, it's true. If we carve a pile of cow dung on the right cheek, no one would buy it. But if we carve a pig, it would be both fat and stupid. Business would definitely be good.""</s>",He sounded very pleased with himself. 'A pig's trotter: that's what I'll carve. No one will be able to refuse to buy it. And a pig is fattener and more stupid than a deer's hoof. A pig-carver's trade must be a good one.',"He is quite proud, saying: ""Ah, carve a pile of cow dung on the right side of my face, but no one will pay money to buy cow dung. It would be better to carve a pig, both fat and stupid, the business will definitely be good.""","Ha!' said Trinket, 'You'd never get money for a cow-pat, but a pig with a tattooed face would be worth a fortune. You'd make a fortune!'"

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","On each side of the road, rows of tall rice stalks stand like pillars, interlocking, filling up with space, gazing at one another, gray-green stalks of rice waiting for a glance.

叶文洁推开阮雯的家门，发现抄家后混乱的房间变得整洁了，那几幅被撕的油画又贴糊好挂在墙上，歪倒的钢琴也端正地立在原位，虽然已被砸坏不能弹了，但还是擦得很干净，残存的几本精装书籍也被整齐地放回书架上……,"Wenjie pushed open the door to Ruan's home, and she saw that the chaos left by the Red Guards had been cleaned up: The torn oil paintings had been glued back together and rehung on the walls; the toppled piano had been set upright and wiped clean, though it was broken and could no longer be played; the few books left behind had been put back neatly on the shelf....","Yuan Wenjian opened the door of Lin Weihan's house, discovering that the mess had been tidied up after the house was plundered.

谁知狗儿利名心重，听如此说，心下便有些活动； 又听他妻子这番话，便笑道：“老老既这么说，况且当日你又见过这姑太太一次，为什么不你老人家明日就去走一遭，先试试风头儿去？”,"Gou-er's cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law, and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife's. 'Well, if it's as you say, Grannie, and being as you've already seen this lady, why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?'","How could one guess that a dog would have such great prestige, and when he heard her words, his heart began to stir; but when he heard what she said about her wife, he laughed: ""Why should I go out of my way if you see this auntie again? Why don't you go out of your way and try your luck first?""","Seeing what Doer had to say, it was no wonder that he began to tinker; and since his wife had preceded him so fully in talking him into coming, a smile curved his face. 'Well, of course you must all agree that it is high time we went visiting to see who she is like. Tomorrow evening your grandson will be able to tell you whether he likes it yet.'","Who knew that the dog's heart was so greedy for honor? Hearing this, his heart began to beat a little more rapidly; when he heard what his wife said, he laughed and said: ""If you say so, I will go tomorrow. Why not see how it goes by taking a walk first?""","At听这些话, Gou-er's competitive nature seemed to have some激活。 Then he heard his wife's new explanation, and he burst out laughing: 'Well, old lady, you're right! You know that you've met Her Ladyship before; why shouldn't I try my hand at this first by going with you only once?'","Who would have known that Goatherd, driven by his desire for fame and fortune, would be swayed upon hearing this? After listening to his wife's words, he chuckled, ""Well, if you're so insistent on this, and considering you've met Auntie Ma once before, why not let you go tomorrow, as a test to see how things stand?""","Yet Jia Rui's utilitarian nature was offended by this last remark and a glimmer of interest flickered in his eyes. 'Come on, Granddad,' he said, addressing the old man, 'you say that we ought to go. You've already met this Mrs Guanyin once. Why don't you go round to her place tomorrow and see how she feels things? Find out what she thinks about all this business first, before we make up our minds what to do.'","Who knows how much the dog loves fame, and when he hears these words, his heart starts to stir. Then, when he hears his wife's response, he laughs and says, ""Since my old man said so, and since you've already met that lady once, why don't you go visit her tomorrow and see how it goes?""","Hearing this somewhat vague but, to Gou-er's sensitive nature, very attractive proposal, and coupled with his wife's advice, he felt himself impelled to take some action. After a moment's reflection he said: 'If you think it's all right, Mother, and provided you think it's all right, I don't see why I shouldn't go. Why, didn't you used to work for the mistress before she married? Why shouldn't you go and pay her a visit tomorrow and see what sort of impression you make?'","Who knows that a dog's name is heavy in his heart, hearing such words, there is some activity in my heart; furthermore, hearing his wife say this, he laughed and said: ""Since you say it like that, moreover, on that day you didn't see that aunt even once, why don't you go see her tomorrow, try to test the wind and see?""","Gou-er's interest was aroused by all this. When the old lady proceeded to criticize her own humble servant, he could not help smiling; and when, after a moment's reflection, he saw that she meant what she said, he laughed out loud. 'Well, if you think it's all right, I don't see why I shouldn't go myself tomorrow and have a look at this Grannie Liu and her 'wind's head',' he said."

像她们这样半路上的朋友，各有各的隐衷，别看严家师母竹筒倒豆子，内中也有自己未必知道的保留，彼此并不知根知底，能有一些同情便可以了。,"People like them, who become friends at mid-life, tend to keep part of themselves hidden away. Even Madame Yan, who usually wore her heart on her sleeve, retained certain secrets that she herself might not have understood. It was not necessary for them to know everything there was to know about each other—a little sympathy went a long way.","Like this kind of friend who meets halfway, each has their own secret, but even when it seems that Li Chen's mother is just throwing around beans in a jar, there’s also something she might not know, so we can’t really know her or her family.","A like-minded relationship between two classmates on a journey means that, while Madame Yan's竹筒里的豆子可说是天下之大奇,王琦瑶却也因不了解其内部的结构而难以说清楚其中的缘由,她们之间的友情也是建立在猜忌的基础上,有时甚至是同情的基础上的。","As for those friends who came along halfway, each has his own secret, and although Madame Jade knows no secrets herself, there must be some that she does not know about. They do not know each other very well, but they can share some sympathy with each other.","Wang Qiyao and her friends had no such secrets; they chattered on endlessly, but this was at the cost of leaving nothing private. They looked down on Gu and felt entitled to know everything about her, although they were unaware that she felt the same way. All they wanted was sympathy.","Friends like them, who join along the way, have their own secrets. Although Mrs. Yan, the master of the严 family, might seem to pour her heart out like a bamboo spilling its beans, there are also aspects of herself that she may not fully understand or know. Given that we don't truly know each other's backgrounds, it's enough to show some empathy towards each other.","These friends made half-way through life have their own secrets; even the most voluble of them—like Madame Yan, for example—keep a few things inside that they are not entirely aware of. She and Wang Qiyao do not need to know one another's secrets; all they require is mutual understanding and goodwill.","Like this, friends who meet by chance along the way, each has their own hidden motives. Don't look down on the mistress of the strict family, who pours beans into a bamboo tube. There are secrets even she may not know, and similarly, there are things about each other that they may not know. A little bit of empathy is enough.</s>","Each had her own hidden motives when she made up to Madame Yan, and even her closest friends did not know all there was to know about her. But as long as there was some sympathy between them, that seemed enough.","As with her friends walking along the way, each has their own intentions, don't be deceived by Madam Zhu of the Zhu family pouring beans into a bamboo tube, there may be things they themselves don't know about her reservations. They don't know each other's roots or bottoms, a little sympathy is enough.","As for themselves, they concealed their true feelings from one another: Madame Yan kept her distance, while Wang Qiyao reserved her kindness for those she knew intimately. They were, after all, strangers who had been thrust together under unusual circumstances; they had no desire to reveal too much to one another, but were capable of extending a few gestures of kindness out of simple decency."
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'","Qian Xiaobang wanted to know what the “Shengtong Temple” and “Cangping穴” were, how to point them out, and what to do with them, but then he thought, I am a master of the Shengtong Temple, as well as the head of the General’s Pavilion, and even though I cannot point or dislocate these points, wouldn’t it be too bad for my subordinates if they look down on me? In fact, dealing with a little girl is not that difficult. He nodded his head and said: “Yes.”","Trinket began to ask the young man questions about the spots, but as he reflected on it, he realized that he was actually the Misty Tower practitioner who had brought the old eunuch with him when he came to China—whether or not this girl in front of him was any less important than their Green Wood Headmaster and his younger brother—and that it would be no trouble for him to cure her of anything he might want to know. Besides, there were so many younger eunuchs in the Palace, none of whom could really be considered a 'expert' enough to treat a 'prince' like Trinket, and he should never try to put his senior down. So he decided to say nothing about the little girl and let her go unasked. He nodded his head and went on his way.","Wu Xiaoya wanted to know what he meant by the Heavenly Hall point and the Ring Point, how to do acupuncture and disacupuncture, but then he thought about it, as a chief of the Green Wood Hall and a disciple of the Grand Master, he wouldn’t even be able to do acupuncture or disacupuncture himself, which would make his subordinates look down upon him. Anyway, dealing with a little girl was not such a difficult matter, so he nodded and said, “I’ve got it.”","Trinket was about to ask him what those acupoints were, but then thought better of it. As Helmsman's apprentice and the Helmsman's pupil's helmsman, he had to some extent to know these things, but the question seemed a bit silly, and anyway he wasn't expecting it to be asked. It didn't seem like much effort to deal with a小姑娘像。 He gave a little nod.","Vexed by the question, Wei Xiaobao was about to ask what the Heavenly Temple's acupoint was, how to find it, or how to unblock it, but then he thought: as the head of the Green Wood Sect and a disciple of the headmaster, if I don't even know how to locate or unblock an acupoint, wouldn't that make my subordinates look down on me? Since dealing with a young girl wasn't exactly a difficult task, he nodded his head and said, ""I understand.""","It was obvious that the man wanted to ask Trinket what a 'shen point' or 'dou hole' was and how one went about stimulating them or unlocking them, but then he seemed to remember that as Triad Leader and apprentice to the Helmsman he must already know all about such things, so there was no need to ask. 'Yes,' said Trinket.","I don't think it's necessary to explain everything in detail. It's not polite to ask questions that are too personal. And as a disciple of the Sect Master, I don't think it's appropriate for me to ask about such things. However, I can tell you that the term ""神堂穴"" refers to a secret technique that is used in martial arts. It involves using your hands to tap certain pressure points on the body, which can be used to cause pain or even unconsciousness. As for ""环跳穴,"" it's a technique that involves jumping and spinning around while using your hands to strike pressure points. As for how to use these techniques, it's something that requires years of practice and training. But I'm sure you'll learn it all in due time. And as for the girl you mentioned, I'm sure you'll find it's not too difficult to handle her. After all, she's just a little girl.""","Trinket was wondering what these were and how one went about closing them and what the consequences of doing so would be; but then he reflected that as the Helmsman had him at his mercy, there was no point in admitting his ignorance. 'Yes, Goong-goong!'","Wei Xiaobao asked about what ""God Hall Hole"" and ""Ring Jump Hole"" are, how to press and release them, but then he thought, as a junior disciple of the Green Wood Hall and the overall helmsman, not knowing how to press and release points would make his subordinates look down on him. After all, dealing with a young lady should not be a difficult task, he nodded and said: ""Understood.""","Trinket was wondering what Goddess-hall and Ring-jumping points were, and how one went about opening them up and closing them, but then thought better of it. After all, he was a disciple of the Helmsman, and if he didn't know the answers to questions like that, he must be very badly informed; and he certainly didn't want to be rude to the girl by asking. 'I know,' he said, and nodded."

下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill.

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","We had no choice but to guess at what he meant when we heard it. Because his father-in-law had always tried hard to buy land for him as a son, and now that his old age is evident, he could not help but feel a little curious about its purpose. Also, he wanted to show off his own dignity. He laughed and said: ""Old Old, you can relax.","By this time on her way there all expectations for the contents of the letter had vanished. Zhou Rui's husband, in spite of the force of his son's dog-eat-dog world, had given such an impression in the previous day with his dealings with the landowners that Two Gou had given up hope of catching him by surprise and preferred, in order to show his own sagacity, to leave a few questions unexplained.","Wu Rui’s wife heard this and guessed at what was coming. It was because her husband had acquired the land by buying it back from his father-in-law several years ago, that he had received help from a dog who had once been his father-in-law’s helper. Seeing Liu Lao-Lao like this, he couldn’t resist his desire; secondly, he wanted to show off his face. He said, ""Old old, you can rest assured.""","By the time Zhou Rui's wife had finished listening, she had fairly guessed the purpose of their visit. But it was a pity that her husband should have waited until now to tell him how much money they had finally spent on the farm. It was a just补偿， for his father had done so much to win over Grannie Liu's hostelmasters by buying land for them. Moreover, he thought it only fair that they should show off their largesse before him. So with a smile on her face, she went on: 'Trusty Grannie, don't you worry!","Zhou Rui's household, having heard this, guessed the intent behind it. It was because her husband had once relied heavily on Dog Er's father's power to purchase land that she found it hard to refuse the old man's request now. And also, she wanted to show off her own status. She laughed and said, ""Old man, please rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife had already some idea of what had brought Grannie Liu. Her husband had frequently expressed admiration for Mr Gou's generosity when he was alive, and was now willing to help the humblest of his benefactors out of trouble in order to show off her own importance. 'Please don't worry,' she said with a smile.","Upon hearing it, he already had a few suspicions. However, he had a strong feeling that it was due to his father-in-law's influence in buying the land, and he didn't want to reveal it. Therefore, he smiled and said, ""Don't worry, old man.""</s>","Zhou Rui's wife, who had at one time quarrelled with her own husband over a piece of land and had subsequently become beholden to Grannie Liu's son-in-law for his financial assistance, felt she could ill refuse an invitation extended in such hospitable language. At the same time she was anxious not to miss an opportunity of getting herself a bit of the limelight. She smiled brightly at Grannie Liu. 'Oh Grannie, don't worry about us!","Zhou Rui's family understood, guessing a few things from it. It was because his husband had argued over buying land in the past, gaining the favor of his father-in-law, and now seeing Liu Lao Lao in such a state, he couldn't help but suppress his thoughts; secondly, he also wanted to show off his own status. He then said, ""Don't worry, old Liu.""","Zhou Rui's mind was already running ahead of her words. It was not without some misgiving that she had made so unguardedly of her husband's strength in the matter of the land; and now, confronted with this venerable gentleman's claim to be older than her own, she was impelled both by a desire to save face and a fear of offending him by too openly contradicting him, to express herself in words which, to her own mind, contained a good deal of irony.

此方人家俱用竹篱木壁，也是劫数应当如此，于是接二连三牵五挂四，将一条街烧得如火焰山一般；彼时虽有军民来救，那火已成了势了，如何救得下? 直烧了一夜方息，也不知烧了多少人家。,"And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process.","This house is made of bamboo walls and wood fences, too. It's fitting that this should happen, so it was followed by a series of steps: cutting off two, then cutting off five, then cutting off four, all at once, and setting fire to the street like a hot mountain. At that time, even though there were civilians who came to help, the fire had already reached its peak, how could they save it down? They burned for one night before it died down. Could they have burnt more than half a dozen homes?","This area of town, therefore, had built itself up under the duress of the Balcones and the Bamboo Scales, with which this city of merchants and brothels had agreed to build its buildings, having suffered a series of arson attempts starting spontaneously from the hoarded fire-wood supplied by the soldiers and civilians on their way from the streets. At first the military leaders believed that the townspeople would be able to burn their houses themselves, but after another few hours the大火已经施于人间的性质, and no one could devise a way through it to extinguish it; hence the night was spent in waiting for the night army to come and rescue them. Not until morning did anyone find out how many houses had been burned.","This family had furniture made of bamboo and wood, and it was meant that this should be the way things would go, so they continued to burn houses like a burning mountain; even then, when there were soldiers and civilians coming to save them, how could they put out the fire? It burned all night long, and they did not know how many houses were burnt.","Every family in this neighborhood uses thatching and pole-walls for their doors and gates, so it follows that in this sort of place like the one we live in there must be as many Revelations as there are houses, and soon a chain of fires, beginning at one end and ending at the other, ensues, burning down一条街道就像一座火焰山一样。 At least once in the course of the night the firefighters were able to bring it under control; but how many households had been destroyed in all?","In this neighborhood, every household used bamboo fences and wooden walls. It was as if it was their fate to be like this. As a result, one after another, they strung out like a chain, setting fire to the entire street, making it resemble a mountain of flames. Even though soldiers and civilians came to save it at that time, the fire had already gained momentum; how could they save it? The fire burned for an entire night before it finally subsided, and no one knew how many homes were destroyed.","In this district people used bamboo fences and wooden walls, and it seemed fated that sooner or later they should all be burnt down, for, following one another in quick succession, those fires had turned a long stretch of street into a great fiery mountain, so that, though troops and civilians came rushing round to help to put them out, by the time they arrived the fires had already got started and there was no putting them out any more. They continued burning for a whole night, and when at last they died down, it was estimated that more than one hundred and fifty homes had been destroyed.","This family uses bamboo fences and wooden walls, which is inevitable during a calamity. As a result, one street was set on fire and became like a mountain of flames. Even though the soldiers and civilians came to help, it was too late to save the situation. The fire burned for an entire night and destroyed many homes.</s>","The walls and hedges of bamboo and wooden partitions marking out the different quarters were set alight, and the great wall enclosing the city followed suit, until the whole street was one ball of fire. By the time the troops and the people came rushing to the rescue, the conflagration was already out of control and the firemen were powerless to stop it. It raged for a whole night, destroying countless houses and driving out their inhabitants.","This method is using bamboo fence and wooden wall, it should be like this in a raid, so they pulled two and connected three, hung four, and set a whole street on fire, like a mountain of fire flames; at that time, there were soldiers and civilians coming to rescue, but the fire had already gained momentum, how could they rescue it? It took a night to extinguish, and it was unknown how many houses were burned down.

Translation: This method used bamboo fences and wooden walls, as it should be in a raid. They connected two, pulled three, hung four, and set a whole street on fire, resembling a mountain of fire flames. Although soldiers and civilians came to rescue, the fire had already gained momentum. It took a night to extinguish, and it was unknown how many houses were burned down.","The inhabitants of that quarter all used bamboo and wood for walls, and since robbery is a matter of technique, it is not surprising that they should have been unable to withstand the onslaught. By the time the military deputy and the villagers arrived, the fire was already out of control and there seemed to be no hope of saving the quarter. It was not until the following morning, after the fire had burned itself out, that the extent of the damage became apparent."

只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。,"Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.","Only the father, brothers, and uncles of a man, being the teachings of the sages, they must not violate them; therefore, even among brothers, they should not go so far as to include themselves, but rather be limited to the extent that is necessary for the sake of their sons.","Because of the way the圣人留下的法则不允许, 我虽是孙子，却也不得不保守族规，只论守就是了, 并不像慈父那样有所期望，要求自己的儿子也必须得成为如慈父一般的人才而已。","Only the father, uncles and brothers are men who have received instructions from the Sage. Therefore, between brothers, it is enough just to do what they should; I am not a man who needs to be an example for my brothers as their elder.","It was on the model of Confucius that this kind of thing was performed: although, as long as they did not directly contradict what he said, they could give somewhat fuller particulars and even deviate a little from the ideal of a gentleman which it embodies. They never regarded themselves as male figures to be imitated by younger ones.","Only, when it comes to father-son, uncle-nephew, and brother-brother relationships, I dare not defy the teachings of sages due to their status as inherited wisdom. Therefore, within brotherly relationships, we merely aim to fulfill the basic expectations without aspiring to be a model for others to follow, simply because one is male.","This was, of course, because it was a principle laid down by Confucius and incapable of being breached without serious moral consequence. Consequently, though brothers and uncles and paternal elders, they each contented themselves with performing their duties in the broadest, most perfunctory way – 'doing their level best', in other words – rather than aspiring to be role models or leaders among their peers.","Only the father, uncle, and brother of a sage's descendants are not allowed to go against his teachings. Therefore, even among siblings, they do not exceed their duties and responsibilities. They do not think of themselves as men and do not aspire to be role models for their younger siblings.</s>","As a member of his own family, a son is in duty-bound to his father and his uncle; and as a younger brother, he has no right to set an example to his younger siblings.","This is a matter of filial piety, uncle-nephew, and brotherly relationships, which are based on teachings from sages, and therefore should not be disrespected. As a result, among siblings, they do not seek to exceed their due role and stop there, and they do not wish to act as individuals, but rather set an example for their juniors.","It's because they're holy men that they have to stick to their bargains and not break them, no matter how silly they may seem to outsiders. And since my father and Uncle are holy men, we brothers just have to do the best we can and not worry about being men of honour or anything like that."

薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。,"'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.","Peng Ben said that he would not have dared to disturb him if it were not for his birthday: because on the 3rd of January, it was my birthday, but I did not know where they had come from. It was quite coarse, long, and so soft; it was a large fresh pumpkin; it was so big that it resembled a giant fish.","I'm afraid I couldn't manage it on my own,' said Bao-yu, 'because by the time the month's end there must have been already gone over half a dozen or more corsages and several hundred flowers for him to choose from. They would have cost quite a lot of money, and besides he doesn't seem to have got these from anyone ordinary; he must have gotten them from some experienced people.","Wang Xiaopan said, ""I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been ordered to."" He had only dared to do so because the day before last was his birthday, and he happened to meet some people who were not very familiar with him: a big, long, fragrant lotus root; a large watermelon; a pig and fish that were sent by the Siamese court as a gift of respect.","I wouldn't have asked for help if I didn't need to, but it's my birthday on the threerd of the following month and so when I found a fucking thick one down at Uncle Hu's place and a really fucking nice, really fucking long one at Great-Granddad's, I was a bit worried they'd all been brought in by some old chum of theirs who goes hopping all over the place like,' said Trinket. 'And what did I find when I cut open the fucking thing? A fucking big, fucking nice, fucking Hmong pork buns and a fucking big fucking Siam elephant-scented pineapple!","Xue Pan said, ""If it wasn't, I wouldn't have dared to disturb you: only because on the third day of the first lunar month, it was my birthday. Who knew that Old Hu and Old Cheng found such things from who knows where: so thick, so long, fresh lotus root; such large watermelons; such long, such large Siamese tribute of fragrant cypress wood-smoked Siamese pigs and fish.""","I'm sure I wouldn't dream of troubling you if it wasn't for the reason that it falls on the third of the first month tomorrow that my birthday is to be celebrated,' said Xue Pan. 'I was wondering where they could have got all these things from: this nice, fresh, crisp water-atom, for example; and this large, perfectly round watermelon; and these long, thin, aromatic rosewood pigs and fish from the Siamese Court.","""Ah, I wouldn't dare to disturb them. It's because next month on the third day, it's my birthday. Who knew that old Hu and old Chen found these things somewhere? They're so thick, so long, and so crispy. And these are such big watermelons. They're so big, and they're from Siam. And these are such long, fragrant Siamese incense sticks. They must have come from Siam. And these are such big, smoky Siamese pigs and fish.""","'I hadn't,'said Whiskers. 'But it is my birthday, the third of the first month. And how do you think Hu and Cheng and the others got all this stuff? There's so much of it! And it's all so excellent! There are the Alouatte ginger-infused Borneo pork and the Alouatte honeydew melons, and the Tibetans' Borneo pepperkins...","Xuanzong Dao: ""Perhaps I wouldn't dare to disturb: only because the third day of next month is my birthday, who knew that Old Hu and Old Chen came from afar: so coarse, so long, fragile and pink lotus; so big the watermelon; so long, so big the Xiaoxia brocade from Xiping tribute of spirit tree incense-infused Xiaoxia pig, fish.""

Translation: Xuanzong Dao: ""Perhaps I wouldn't dare to disturb, as it's my birthday next month. I didn't expect Old Hu and Old Chen to come from afar. They brought such coarse, long, fragile, pink lotus; such a big watermelon; such long, big Xiaoxia brocade from Xiping tribute, infused with spirit tree incense, for pigs and fish.""","If I hadn't been born on the third of the next month, I shouldn't have been worried about offending them by refusing, but as it is my birthday, I thought it wouldn't do to offend them by refusing."

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her part, she had complained a lot about Mr. Chen’s bed, but Mr. Chen also left behind countless wishes for her, all of which were not fulfilled by the state-owned enterprise and the real estate industry. The end result was that she could no longer secure one private house as God’s favor or heaven’s grace.","For her part, she had made a big mess while taking over the business; Mr. Yan,枕上百般愿意，眠中万般眷恋，终于只成一句:「恩恩，当地政府分给我们的这笔巨款，我已向天报到了，恳请皇上立即发赈，将这处我们各自所有但共建不造的私人花园弄平，新建一栋为国尽忠、为士子耕种的豪华大宅！」","For this, she had been complaining incessantly, and Mr. Yan had pledged his thousand words and ten thousand vows on the pillow that all private property would be taken over by the state, and that even if he could save a private house, it was as if heaven and earth were gifting him with such a privilege. The garden villa turned out to be nothing but a dream.","Madame was furious. And Mr. Yan made a thousand promises and oaths that he would never allow their home to be nationalized, but then state-run enterprise became reality and the answer was no to her request for a apartment in the backyard.","For this, she had complained endlessly, and Mr. Yan had made countless vows and oaths on his pillow. But when the private businesses were consolidated into state enterprises, all their properties were seized by the state. It was considered divine grace to be able to keep even one private house intact. The dream of a garden villa finally turned out to be just a bubble.","For this reason, she had often complained, while her husband solemnly pledged himself to her in front of the wedding pillow only to break his promises when, nationalization came along and the government took away all their property except a single townhouse which, thanks to divine intervention, was the now-garden apartment they had dreamed of.","She grumbled incessantly, and even her husband's pillow had thousands of promises written on it. But despite their joint efforts, their business ended up being nationalized, and they could only keep a small private room. The garden villa became a mirage.","For this she had plenty to be grateful for, and Mr. Yan, resting his head on hers, made all kinds of vows and pledges, promising with equal zeal to repay her kindness with his own. Never, he vowed, would he allow the state to take over their joint enterprise; he would fight to the death to keep their private property safe. In the end, however, it was the state that got everything. The fruit of their joint venture became a mirage, the mansion and garden a vanished dream.","For this, she didn't lack flirtatious remarks, Zhang Laoshi also placed countless wishes and vows on his pillow, unexpectedly, public and private enterprises merged, all industries fell into the hands of the state. Keeping one private property was considered a blessing from heaven and earth, the garden villa eventually became a fleeting shadow.","Consequently she was not slow in making up her mind what to do, and by the time that Mr. Yan had got used to his new bed, he had already drawn up a thousand and one plans for their future life together. However, the merger of public and private enterprise into a single state-run industry had left no room for a private household like theirs, and the beautiful garden mansion had gone the way of all such enterprises—into oblivion."

However, upon being asked by Rui Chou, he felt a pain in every bone and muscle throughout his body, and he couldn't help but let out a sigh.","Trinket had covered a considerable distance on foot, and though the pain in his side was bearable, the answer to Blossom's question seemed to affect every bone and sinew in his body and he winced uncontrollably.","Wu Xiaobao took a deep breath and walked towards him, ignoring the pain in his body. He asked Qin Ersheng, ""How are you feeling?""

看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I had a bit of joy at first glance but also some unease. For these women stood so far away, they could not hear what was said there, and there was a woman wearing a sleeping robe who lay on several different positions. She was lying sideways, bent over, and then she was leaning against the wall. Another one lay facing the wall with her legs stretched out flat, while the other half of her body was hanging off the ground. The half-hidden sleepwear was covering her body. The bed was wrinkled as well. It was a little too much for me to stand in front of.","The sight of them standing outside the curtain made its way inside her heart a little, even though all she could see was the direction in which they were lying. They were a couplee, on their side, with a bed already set up; another was on her back, stretched out on her hands and knees; and a third, one of the women guessed, had somehow rearranged herself so that her body was tilted towards the headboard and that she was lying on her back with her legs over the edge of the room—a single sheet covering nothing but her shoulders. The last picture showed her body completely outside of the sheet, showing clearly how it was beginning to show age.","There was a little happiness and a little boredom in my heart as I read this, for they were standing too far away to hear what was being said there, so all I could see was one woman lying on her bed, laying in various positions, first with her back turned, then with her face up, and the other time only half of her body was laid down while the other half was hanging down to the ground. Her transparent nightgown covered most of her body, and the bed was already wrinkled.","Wang Qiyao's heart averted joy was mixed with distaste. She kept at arm's length so as not to miss anything, but she couldn't help noticing how awkward they looked standing there. The one woman, wearing a transparent nightie, lay on her side; the other, on her back; and another, only the top half of her body was exposed, her legs dangling off the side of the bed. The thin, translucent nightie added nothing to her elegance; the bed was pitted with wrinkles, and the scene was a little disgusting.","The sight stirred a mix of pleasure and weariness within me. The distance between us prevented me from hearing their conversation, but I could see a woman in a see-through robe lying on a bed, changing positions repeatedly. She lay on her side, then facing upwards, and once half her body was stretched out while the other half hung down. Her translucent robe clung to her body, causing the bed to wrinkle slightly, which was also somewhat off-putting.","He felt a twinge of something when he saw this woman lying in different positions on the bed—perhaps lust, perhaps aversion. The other two could not hear what was being said but could see a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed. They saw her change positions several times: once on her side, another time facing up, then almost all the way up to her waist, the other half of her body hanging down. The see the transparent nightgown clinging to her body, the bed protesting against the pressure of her weight—a scene that, like the sounds from the studio, somewhat bored her.","Looking at her, I felt a bit happy, but also a bit uneasy. Because they were far away, I couldn't hear what they were saying, but I could see a woman lying on the bed, posing in different ways. She lay on her side, then on her back, and once with only half her body lying on the bed, with the other half hanging down. Her semi-transparent sleepwear was wrapped around her body, and the bed was wrinkled, with a bit of an uneasy feeling.</s>","Wu Peizhen felt a strange sense of disgust. She was too far away to hear what they were saying, but could make out that the woman in the doorway was lying on the bed, alone, in a state of extreme relaxation, the transparent garment she had on clinging tightly to her body. The sheet under her had become rumpled and dirty.","I felt a little joy in my heart, yet a bit tired. Since they were far away, I couldn't hear what they were saying, only seeing a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed, trying various poses, one was lying on her side, another was looking up to the ceiling, and there was also one where only half her body was on the bed, the other half hanging down to the floor. Her semi-transparent nightgown wrapped her body, and the bed was wrinkled, also a bit tired-looking.","But at the same time she was a bit bored, since they were so far away that she could not make out what they were saying. She could, however, see a woman lying on the bed. The woman slept in various positions: first on her side, then looking up at the ceiling, and finally with half her body on the bed and the other half hanging over the side. The woman was wearing a transparent smock, and the bedsheets were all wrinkled, as if the woman had slept there many times before."
