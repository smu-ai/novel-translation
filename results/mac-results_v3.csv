虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother is also a harmonious couple with him on his side of the rice field, and in that solemn and solemn period where they were both sorrowful and happy together, I do not have any charge, but it was indeed a proud father of the highland East of the Northern Plains, but then it was just a single man's marriage ceremony as a wedding partner, and there was quite a degree of randomness and instability. Moreover, I did not come from soil yet, so I called him ""Luo Xue Qing"" more accurately when writing about the things at that time.","Even though my grandma had already been blossoming in the sorghum fields under the direction of her father, who was a single man from Northeast Gaomi Township, where she was a married man who at once shared pain with me and at the same time compensated Granddad for his crime, she still held a certain elegance and refined refinement in those highland northeast villages where, when the soil rested on her head, she was a married wife who, having been adopted, felt at once relief and annoyance toward my grandfather. Also, despite the fact that he hadn't born any children, by which time it was already possible to call him Cousin Amtu more appropriately.","Although my grandmother had been harmoniously married with him in the field of corn, she was still happily pregnant at that time, but despite her being a half-dirty, half-fortunate father, I should call her a single house wife who was engaged in marriage by the family. My grandfather had been married to her as well, so it was not very stable or fixed, and even though my father hadn’t fallen off the earth yet, I shouldn’t use his name.","Even though Grandma had consummated her love for Yu Cang in the sorghum field, reaching harmony and happiness, she remained a half-crazed, half-cursed child born of a father who walked among the gourd fields of Northeast Gaomi Township — a man who, like his father before him, had been tied to his wife and loved unconditionally. But Grandma was not a virgin; she had not fallen into debt to society. So, even when it came time to write about this period in her life, I called her by the name of her father, Yu Cang.","Although my grandmother was not a part of this solemn ceremony on the soil of the high粱 field, she had indeed given birth to me, even though her pregnancy was complicated by the dual nature of guilt and honor. At that time, when I was still a child, my grandfather was married to my mother as well as my father, but they were always together under the auspices of their family's marriage and the natural conditions of their union. This degree of randomness, instability, and uncertainty was so great that I would call him ""Xu Jie"" rather than ""Xu Zhi"".","Even though she'd already been凤凰三起三落, that joyful mixture of joy and sorrow, she was still one of the few bright sides of the Sorghum Field, where, like my grandfather, she had been married to a fair maiden. And while my father had not borne children, at the time he could have called her my father's concubine; therefore, the topic of our conversation would always have been related to him by the use of the informal term.","Though my grandmother had already made peace with him in the tall grasses, she was still in a half-frightened/half-delighted state in that solemn process when I was pregnant with her guilt mixed with praise. Although my grandmother did carry my sin and praise, she was still a father of the East Jinxiang generation, but at that time, she was still a single wife married by legal marriage to a man from the family of Mengjia, who always had some degree of freedom and chance. Furthermore, my father hadn’t fallen off the ground yet, so it is more accurate to call him Yu Quanliao then.","Although Grandma had consummated her love for him in the sorghum field, she had not completed the sin-and-cleansing equation; so I grew half-evil, half-happy. Even though she'd become a full-time mistress of the single-family Zhou clan, she had not finished the task of making him father number one. But it was true that he had been married against his will, with quite a bit of accident and arbitrariness involved, and that the relationship between them had been based on trust and faithfulness—so much so that he hadn't even fallen back into俗(土)习惯。 So, when it came time to start calling the action in question, I thought it best to stick with 'Yu Zhan' rather than the more correct 'Yu Zhan (geng er)'.","Although my grandmother was with him in the rice fields of happiness and sorrow, it is true that he has been harmoniously married to me in a solemn moment where we both have our own crimes and virtues, but at least I am his father, but when she was single and had no parents, there were some degree of randomness and instability, which makes her a mix of a single man's traditional marriage and the combined household of the palace. She always carries the baggage of a mixed household as well as the baggage of the palace. In addition, I don't know if I fell from soil or not. So when writing about this time, I still call him ""Luo Quang He"" more accurately."

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes. 'You're just like I imagined. Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.'","He changed his image on the media and wore a suit, appearing refined and handsome. He was ""as you imagine it"" - that is, he was elite and well-respected; its contents and essence were common knowledge for most people; but the level of knowledge required to understand it was too low.","Instead, he adopted a refined air of propriety that didn't look dirty but clean-lined and fashionable. 'You're not different from the people on Three Body All Born To Live In The Real World,' he said. 'We aren't like the ordinary people; we're top-class individuals. Three Body isn't only for those who know about scientific facts and mathematics—being able to understand concepts at that sublimacy of knowledge requires a true genius.'","He had changed his usual dirty homeless man look on TV, now he was dressed up in a suit, looking elegant, ""We are similar to you guys, we are all elites. ‘Three body’ is for your kind of people. Its contents and意境, ordinary people can’t understand; knowledge needed to play it is at a high level and its depth is also beyond what common people could have.""","He changed back to a clean-shaven street bum as usual, but this time with a difference: a suit and tie. His new appearance gave him a refined air. 'You are probably right,' he said, his voice carrying a certain aura of authority. 'As the Three Body was prepared for the elite, it is a must for us. The depth of meaning and the sophisticated mind required by the game are above the understanding of common people.'","He changed his image from a man with dirty clothes on the media to a well-dressed gentleman, wearing formal attire, looking like he was a leader of elite groups. The book is designed for those who belong to such classes. Its meaning and essence are difficult to understand; its knowledge required should be too high for most people to comprehend; it's complex and deep, which few can achieve.","The man changed significantly. He wore clean clothes and a整洁西装， but had the air of a former-classy wanderer. 'Not you, Three Body,' he said, the characters were not adapted for the men who worked in the media. But there is something about you that sets Three Body apart. To be a specialist in Three Body means being an exceptionalist. You need vast knowledge in areas beyond your comprehension; to be able to understand something so basic as three hundred thousand readiedly compiled by scientists as a secret weapon against space-time illusion.'","He has changed his usual dirty street urchin look on TV screens for a well-dressed dandy, ""You guys are just as I imagined, all of you are elites. ‘Three Body’ is for people like you. Its contents and meanings are beyond your comprehension; what you need to know about it requires a level of knowledge that is impossible for you.""","Dressed in a suit and leather shoes, he looked as stylish as a celebrity. 'You wouldn't believe how similar you are to me,' he said, changing into his old self. 'We're all the same, you know: the elite.' He continued, 'Three Body was prepared for people like us. Although the game is hard, its profundity and inner beauty are beyond understanding by common folk. And the knowledge required to play it is extremely advanced, deep as well.'","He changed his appearance on media in a way that was more of a downtrodden street criminal, wearing suits with a polished look.

这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。,"It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.","The people who claim they are the ""Master of香气"" are simply making up their own nonsense by saying things like ""We have no idea what your will is, but we must obey it"". The real reason behind this is that each person already has a plan of action inside their minds. They just hope for someone to agree with them, so they do everything under the nose of the ""Master of香气"". In the future, they won't be involved in important matters at all.","It is their elders who stand as祭司口头的神甫, who tell us what to do in accordance with his commands. But all along the way the boys have been默守其政, silently determining what they really wish from him—and all the while they have been secretly preparing their own replies should their master decide. By which time it is too late for them to appeal to him; and they simply let it drop, knowing that he shall now be the centre of every discussion.","These people, who call themselves ""masters"" and say such things as ""waiting for a master's orders"", really have their own minds already. They just want to get their approval so that they can avoid any major responsibilities. Therefore, once these people are blamed, they will not be held responsible at all.","These eunuchs talk with their mouths about how they await their master's instructions; but deep down they all have their own ideas and are merely waiting for Trinket to give them an order. Once he is satisfied, all responsibility for the actions that will follow falls on Trinket. From then on it is up to him how far they go.","These people boast that they are the custodians of a sacred flame, promising that any advice will be given by their master without delay. However, the truth is that each one has already had his or her own plans in mind, hoping for approval from their master. Therefore, all these things were put on their shoulders, and eventually they would not have a major role to play.","It is the same with the people speaking of their Master. All they say when anyone else asks them what their instructions are are 'May I have your services?'—'I expect you will give me such and such a order.' But all they imply inwardly is, 'I wish I were your Comrade-remain unimproviated.' They have already long formed their own opinions about who their task was and what lay ahead of them. They merely hope that their master will agree with them—and this greatly depends on their agreeing． . . . In the end it is the individual who endorses Whiskers who carries on the business of transporting the Prince to his quarters—that is, to speak frankly—a task which involves no great importance, and who therefore takes no credit for himself at all.","These people spoke of themselves as the Master of Incense when they were speaking with their mouths full, saying things like ""waiting for a master's orders."" In fact, each had already made up his mind. He just wanted to get it approved by the Master of Incense so that he would not be held responsible for any major issues later on.","These eunuchs always refer to themselves as 'Aroma Main Man' and, whenever they talk about waiting for their master's instructions, are thinking up all sorts of things to do while he is away. All they want is for him to agree to be their mistress, and then all manner of mischief they could get up would be shifted on to someone else's conscience -- yours, Master, in this case.","The people who speak of themselves as the Master of the香气， talk about what they should be waiting for from the香气 Master's orders; in fact, each person has already got a plan in his or her mind, just hoping that he or she will get approval from the香气 Master, so that one day they won’t have any major responsibility."

She does not know what is hidden inside her own chest, but she can understand that others do not know it either. If they can show some understanding, then they will be happy enough.","If they were to claim each other as friends, they would have to make some sacrifices. It was true that Madame Yan spilt beans like a dripping bamboo barrel, but there must be things she did not know about her friend that she did not share; none of them placed themselves entirely in their friend's shoes, and all they wanted in return for their devotion was a bit of understanding and sympathy.","Like friends who meet halfway on the way, each with their own hidden inclinations, I don’t mean to say that Uncle Li is a fool for putting up such a joke; there may be something we didn’t know that he doesn’t know either.

韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'",Qian Xiaobang wanted him to know what a Heaven Pavilion穴和环跳穴是什么意思，怎样用功法来点穴和解穴，但转过头来看，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴都不会，难道会让下属们看轻他？反正对付一个小姑娘的事情也不是很难，点头应道：“知道了。”,"I don't know about that secret word you're talking about, Brother,' Trinket was about to asking them what it meant, 'but I do know that it's where a man puts his thumb against whose aim to cause pain and then removes it again as soon as he wants it to stop. It's also the same thing you did when we put our fingers on your target—to give or remove pain as quickly as we want.'","Wu Xiaoliao wanted to ask him what was a ""temple"" point and an ""arrowhead point"", how to do acupuncture and acupressure, but he thought better of it. He was the head disciple of the main hall and the chief of the grotto, so he couldn't even do acupuncture and acupressure. Isn't that embarrassing? Anyway, dealing with a young girl isn't difficult at all. Wu Xiaoliao nodded his head and said, ""I understand.""","He was thinking of asking the questions that involved names of acupoints and how to stimulate them and how to find the same acupoints after one had been stimulated, but he decided it would be enough for him to be a Taoist副主子和舵主的弟子, even though he didn't know what acupoints were, to be looked down on by his subordinates, when he could do nothing of the sort. He settled for a simple 'yes' instead.","Wu Xiaobang wants to know what the ""Shaoyan Pavilion"" and ""Cuihuan Pavilion"" mean, how to tap them, and what to do with them, but he thought back to himself that he was the head of the Young Bamboo Temple, which was the principal's disciple, and even if he could not perform these things, it would not be fair for his subordinates to look down upon him? After all, dealing with a little girl was not something that was difficult at all. He nodded his head: ""I will understand.""","I've no idea what those terms are; I don't know how to use it except to pick a number. I haven't ever done anything like this before myself. So it must be really hard for someone like Brother Wei to find out what a神堂穴是什么意思, or how to do it, or—what matters most—and even getting him to解开我的穴具也不容易。 It's hardly a problem I can solve myself.'","Wu Xiaogang wanted to ask him what he meant by ""sacred hall points"" and ""ring point"". How did he use them? But then he thought of his position as the head monk of the Yellow Wood Hall and his master's disciple, and even if he couldn't use them himself, he didn't want his subordinates to think that he was too incompetent. In the end, it would be fine for a little girl. He nodded and said, ""I understand.""","Trinket was about to ask what the Godit was for and where they got their name 'Ringit' from and whether they were supposed to be able to needle and unneedle them—and all the other things that go with it—but he realised that asking these questions would involve giving the girl one of his greater superiors whom he did not know very well a handout, so he changed his mind and took the girl at her word. 'All right, I've heard,' he said.","Zhu Xiaobang wanted to know what a heaven temple point is, how to point it out, and what to do with it, but when he thought about it, he was a member of the Qingming Temple's headmaster, and his chief secretary was also a student who had been under his tutelage. He could not even point or solve for it, would that really make them all look down on him?"" No problem! I will now tell you."

下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","In the afternoon, when it is time for injections, there is often a gap of about 30 minutes between two injections. This is all empty, just her and I, sitting side by side. The summer has not yet fully gone, and she can’t help but groggy. Summer evenings have left us exhausted, and she cannot help but groggy. She has not quite recovered from the morning nap, which still hasn’t completely passed. It is impossible to tell what was said during the night.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early in the three o'clock time frame. While the hour was empty, a hour or two left free, the girls would stand idly by with their arms encrossled over their heads. Summer illness had yet to work its way away, and they caught odd glances from deadchairs桐树上的蝉吱吱地鸣叫着。 Nobody knew what to say.","They came for shots around 4 or so in the afternoon. This hour was always empty. It was just them two, sitting face to face. The summer sleep had not fully passed, they could not help yawning all the time. They tried to stay awake, but they did not know what they were saying. The cicadas on the branches of a crape myrtle kept calling, it sounded like ""wha-wha-who"".","They usually came in at three or four in the afternoon, leaving the studio empty for them two women, face to face. At that hour, with the困倦刚刚过去的午睡效应, they would begin to feel sleepy, and would yawn, over and over. They tried hard to keep their eyes open, but the cicadas from the walnut tree outside seemed unable to restrain themselves and continued to chirp, their voices growing louder as they moved up the stem of the tree.","In the afternoon, they came at midnight for a shot of injection, leaving the space empty until she and her two companions were sitting side by side. In summer, after the afternoon’s nap had already been completely over, she was still groggy and sleepy. She kept herself from saying anything. The sound of a leaf on a梧桐树上蝉的叫声， which was heard from behind them, was coming in through their ears as well. It sounded like buzzing, not quite clear.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early, around three. The hour was empty, until Tao Wang and Tian Qi's voicephone began calling. Sun Lipt out of her own self-control and threw herself onto the wheel, harrying the scoldings from nowhere until she knew everything she could think of would make them want to wake up.","They came for shots around 4 PM, a time when they were left alone all afternoon. They sat together, with their faces facing each other. It was still too early for them to catch up on sleep after lunchtime naps. They kept yawning. They tried hard not to fall asleep but failed. The sound of crickets chirping from a tree above them reached them through the window, sounding like a constant buzz, and it was impossible to tell if what they heard was real or just a trick of the wind.","They usually来了打针的时间是三点半左右,这一小时里却空荡荡的，只有她们两个人，在一棵梧桐树下面对面坐着。那时天还有点亮，但困意已经开始上身，不时有打哈欠的声音传来，此处便嘈嘈杂杂的，语无伦次。","In the afternoon, when we should have a shot at 3:00 PM, there was always one left open, and they were both sitting alone. Summer’s evening nap had not yet fully passed, and she couldn’t help but groan. She struggled with her thoughts as if she was on a drugstore drug store. She didn’t know what she was saying."

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","The man who heard this said that he had guessed a few things from what was said. Because of his father-in-law's ability to buy land from him many times, now seeing how much his old father-in-law has bought, he felt quite pleased with his own thoughts; also, he wanted to show off his own dignity. He laughed and said, ""Old old you are so free!","By this she could almost tell what the old lady had in view. It was because, during one of his last fights with the village丈人, Grannie Liu had secured a field by means of climbing over their heads, Trinket had needed to raise such strength; and that Grannie Lui had succeeded in forcing them all out, but having made good their损失， so that they could and would like to congratulate each other on their brave deed. Sarcasm being available for play, she gave the寡妇一个承诺，她说：老老你放心，我绝没有向外边去找的意思。","Wang Ru’s ears perked up when she heard this. She knew that the old man wanted to buy a piece of land, but he had received help from her husband’s father in the past. Hearing that the old man was now willing to do so, Wang Ru felt no difficulty about it. Furthermore, she also wanted to show off her dignity. She said with a smile, ""Old man, rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife immediately guessed that her visit was connected with the quarrel about the fields, which she had heard so much about; but she realized presently that it was a more complicated business than this, because the old woman's father had been involved in the transaction; and having now seen her in person, she was gratified at being able to satisfy him her sincerity in coming. 'Old colour, I say! You can rely on us!","Wu Weihang heard that and was able to guess the meaning behind his wife's words. Because he had suspected something about her husband when he first heard of his father buying land. Now that he saw CTC so well, he felt very strange; and also because he wanted to show off his own reputation. He laughed and said: ""I don't care what you think.","By this time Trinket had almost everything he needed to understand a word of what she said. Firstly it was already apparent from his earlier remarks that Old Gu’s wife was trying to persuade him to do something about a matter which had troubled him for some time. She wanted to know whether it was possible to gain land by fighting its way out of certain difficulties; and also, as he could plainly see from the old man’s conversation that he had been thinking it over on his own, to demonstrate his good grumblings, he added with a little glee: 'You go figure, Oldgeorge! You can go away with a Big Dipper!'","Jiuzhe has already guessed what is going on. He knows that his wife's husband bought some land a few years ago with the help of his father-in-law. Now he sees Liu Langlan so well, he can't resist him. Secondly, he also wants to show off his face. So he said, ""Old old, you don't need to worry.""",Zhou Rui's wife guessed at part of their purpose; but it was with a sense of personal embarrassment that she deferred to Mr Gou-er's judgment as a means of avoiding any appearance of improper advantage.,"The Zhou Ran family was already guessing what his wife had meant when she heard this. For he knew that his father had always been there for him, even though he had just won a battle with Liu old man. He laughed and said, ""Old old you have your own mind."

We can't be left here without supervision, which is against the rules.","He also wanted to go out on the street, but didn't get past the screen. Not only was it after their release time, but it also didn't fit our purpose.","He also wanted to go on the street, but it was not until we got back that he would allow us to stay here alone without being watched over by anyone.

此方人家俱用竹篱木壁，也是劫数应当如此，于是接二连三牵五挂四，将一条街烧得如火焰山一般；彼时虽有军民来救，那火已成了势了，如何救得下? 直烧了一夜方息，也不知烧了多少人家。,"And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process.","This house was used for bamboo walls and is fittingly so, thus causing a curse. It then attached two and disconnected four on a single wall, burning up the street like a fireball; while there were people coming to help, the flames had already turned into something that could be extinguished. How can we save them? The fire has been burnt all night, but I don't know how many houses have been burned.","Now,' said the author, 'we would have a bamboo wall within a bamboo wall and a wooden post enclosure within a wooden post – exactly as it ought. So, if we looked down on no one, we were sure to succeed in throwing a large number of houses into flames. Even though the troops and crews from both civilian and military quarters came to assist us, the fire was already in its own master – and how could we hope to extinguish it? We burnt for three nights in vain – but now, after we had finished, we found that we had thrown away more than fifty0 families.","This family is all made of bamboo fences and wooden walls. This is a fate that should be so, so the fire continues to spread. At this time, even if the military and civilians come to help, the fire has become too strong. How could they save it? It burned all night long before it finally died down. They do not know how many houses were burnt during this period of time.","That side of the village was all enclosed by palissades of bamboo and some sort of palisading material that resembled willows rather than stones; counting them all together, it is not surprising that a place where such material burns so fiercely should quickly be extinguished, thanks to the assistance of military and common folk. When the smoke from this blaze died out after yet another day's奋战, it is hard to imagine how many houses had been burned already.","This home is used for bamboo wall and wood panels, also as a curse should be this, so it was tied together with five and four houses; that is how they burnt a street like a fire mountain. At this time, although there were soldiers and civilians who came to help, the fire had already become strong enough that no one could escape. How can we save it? It burned all night and did not know how many homes were burnt.","The house had inside a bamboo wall and a wooden post at the top of the wall, which caused all concerned to set about suicide, and so by the evening they had burnt down nearly as many buildings as they had been scheduled to build; however, since there was no military or naval crew to save them, they had simply blown out the flames themselves and set about burning every building in sight that they saw. By the time the night had ended, they had burnt off more than twice as many as they'd been scheduled to build. The result was that most of those buildings gone, except for those who had first planned them out on military ships or aircraft.
","This family used bamboo fences and wood walls. This is their fate. So they started burning houses one after another. Soon, they were able to burn a street like a fire mountain. At that time, even if there had been soldiers and civilians coming to help, the fire was already too large for them to stop. They burned all night long until it finally stopped. They don’t know how many houses they burnt.","Since we know that it takes a grove of palmbears and a hedge of willows to build a house, it is no wonder that there should be so many fires, with houses alight, and not to stop until at last the land was burned and everything in it was reduced to cinders.","This is how one's belongings were used as a bamboo wall, and also this is a fate that must be like this. So I received two and then placed them on five and put them on four. The street was completely burning up with fire; how could we get down? When there were military and civilians came to help, it had already become dangerous. How can we save this? Only burnt half of the house."
叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上台。 她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。,"Ye's wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd's front row. She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.","The wife of Professor Zhou from her department was standing up at the front row and stepping onto the stage. She wore a very loose green dress that seemed to be close to red hoods, but she had thought about it when she saw someone familiar with Zhou who looked like she was wearing a high-land gown and lecturing on.","Shao Lin, another physics professor, stood up from her seat at the back and made her way to the stage. She wore onlooker's green dress, apparently to close的距离来安慰即将来临的红色oubiences. Shen couldn't help feeling awkward even though she had worn a beautifully fitted kimonie to lectures for many years.","Mrs Ye’s wife, Professor Shen Lin from her department, rose from her seat at the front of the stage and walked up on it. She wore a very unflattering green suit, obviously trying to get closer to the red guards’ colors, but those who knew Professor Shen before noticed that she seemed out of place in such an outfit.","The wife, Professor Shao Lin, rose to the stage from the front row of the crowd. She was wearing a green dress that seemed to try hard to connect with the Red Guards' uniforms, but anyone who knew Sha liked the idea of her wearing something more traditional, like a high-quality旗袍, rather than this strange dress.","The wife of physicist Ye Chetyr was standing at the front row when she stood up from behind her seat. She wore a very loose green dress that seemed to be trying to draw attention to herself, but those familiar with Ye Chetyr thought it strange that she was wearing a dress that was not quite as sophisticated as her previous teaching.","Shao Lin, another physics professor, stood up from her seat behind her husband and walked towards the stage. She put on a pair of green clothes, which was not fitting for her. The students all leaned closer to the red guards, but Shao Lin noticed that, wearing her modest旗袍， she was a bit awkward.","Ye Zhetai’s wife, a physics professor of the same department as hers, Shao Lin rose from her seat at the front of the stage. She wore a very unflattering green suit that seemed to want to be close to the red guards’ colors, but those who were familiar with Shao Lin found it awkward.","Ye Zhetai's wife, with a seat near Wang Guanghui's, Professor Shao Lin, rose to speak. She had risen up from the后排 in the middle of a battle against 'counter-revolutionary perverts,' but, recalled those who knew Shan, she looked odd in her green suit, which seemed out of place next to the red flags of the Red Guards.","The wife of Prof. Liu, who is also a physics professor from the same department, stands up from her seat at the front row and walks to the podium. She wears a very out-of-place green dress, which may suggest she wants to distance herself from the red-hating students' color scheme. But with familiar knowledge of Prof. Liu's attire, it makes her feel awkward."

Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back. Misty had beaten him to it! He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.","Wu Xiaowang said, ""I won't!"" He wanted to stretch his back out and turn him over. Suddenly, his back was aching from being pinched by Xiao Renjie's thumb. The two spots where his hands were strangled had been taught to him by his father yesterday.","I wouldn't!' cried Trinket, as he was attempting to lift him back on to his feet, but as he felt for a sign indicating where the pain was, his small-knife sense of smell led him to recognize a pair ofRouting points in the back of his vest pocket which seemed to denote some difficulty that might be involved in struggling; for the next thing he knew, his both-hand grasp on this last moment was overruled by Misty, who used the time during which she had been holding him there to notice somewhere around the waist where something stiff and tight had been锁定。","Wu Xiaoya said, ""No surrender!"" He wanted to stand up, but suddenly his waist felt numb. The two meridians on his back were already blocked by the little Devil. This was exactly what Little Devil had taught him last night. Although he had learned it, it was given away to someone else.","Take no alliance!' Trinket called back, trying to raise his head again, but suddenly rather numb all round. There was a point on his lower back at which the old eunuch had taught him the kylix手法—— or so he thought. It had clearly been used before he knew what he was doing.","Then he said, 'No!' He wanted to stretch his legs up and lift himself over the top of the head. But when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his left arm, it was as though he had been struck by the heel of a heel-pointing sword, which was what his teacher had taught him yesterday. He didn't even try to use this technique against me, but I had already used it before to get him ahead of me.""","No!' insisted Trinket, struggling to get up again. But just as he did this, there was a sudden sharp pain to his back, and two tiny holes in his jeans became painful enough to keep him stopping him each time he struck. The important things were that Misty had somehow known to invoke this trick in front of him and that he had guessed it at some distance; but even so he had won't have gotten the better of him.","Wu Xiaole said: ""No surrender!""

The two spots of the back were already covered by his disciple's finger-thrusting technique, which was what he had learned, but it had been given to him first by the other person."

'No, but if we assume that our computer is made up of three million soldiers, each of whom waves his or her black-and-white flag a thousand times per second, there would be so much jockeying for position on the network cables that they'd move at the speed of sound or faster.

夜色灰葡萄，金风串河道，宝蓝色的天空深邃无边，绿色的星辰格外明亮。 北斗勺子星——北斗主死，南斗簸箕星——南斗司生、八角玻璃井——缺了一块砖，焦灼的牛郎要上吊，忧愁的织女要跳河…… 都在头上悬着。,"On that grey-purple night a golden breeze followed the course of the river. The sapphire-blue sky was deep and boundless, green-tinted stars shone brightly in the sky: the ladle of Ursa Major (signifying death), the basket of Sagittarius (representing life); Octans, the glass well, missing one of its tiles; the anxious Herd Boy (Altair), about to hang himself; the mournful Weaving Girl (Vega), about to drown herself in the river. . . .","The night is gray with grapes, the wind blows through the river, blue skies stretch on out side of the eyes, green stars shine bright.

The spoon of the north star – death of the northern star, the箕-shaped star of south pole – life of the southern star, the glass well with eight corners – missing a brick, anxious shepherds want to hang themselves, worried weavers want to jump into the river… All hanging above their heads.","Underneath the dark green heavens, a Pocky Bridge, gilded windrows of wheat, and a deep-blue sky where even the stars seem unusually bright afford hints of what may lie in store for those who seek it—the Delimiter Pole shows that the Delimiters have fallen but the Stork Galaxy awaits birth, so the Delimiters' broken watermill indicates that there is a leak in the supporting beam that carries the mill's nameplate; moreover, the absent Guardian Star suggests that the wife of the delimiters has sunk into sorrowful melancholia about the loss of her husband, and the absent Observer Star forebodes that the wife will take her own life rather than burden herself with the pain of losing her husband.","The night is gray with grapes, the wind carries rivers, blue sky vast, the bright stars shine brightly.

The eight corner glasses — the one missing from each corner of the eight corner glasses——are a reminder of the lack of a piece of stone in the constellation of the moon, which is burning with anger. The sorrowful mother of the Virgin Mary is hanging on her head. The sorrowful wife of the Starry Messenger is floating down the river of water."

他自觉得胜，心下高兴，只是小郡主不会说话，未免有些扫兴，要想去解她穴道，却又不知其法，说道：“你给人点了穴道，倘若解不开，不能吃饭，岂不饿死了？,"It was agreeable to have won, but it rather took the gloss off his victory that she couldn't speak.

他想着：“兄弟们一并都有父母教训，何必我多事，反生疏了。 况且我是正出，他是庶出，饶这样看待，还有人背后谈论，还禁得辖治了他？”,"'We are both equally subject to our parents' control,' he would say of himself and Jia Huan. 'Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife's son and he is the concubine's? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.'","He thought: ""The brothers all have parents' lessons; why do I bother? If that were the case, we would have been good friends. And what if I am a real man, he is a peasant, and I should see things as they are, so that there would be others who talk behind his back, and still govern him?""","That's just it,' he thought. 'Both of us will have parents' advice when we reach age; but the trouble is that I am a prospective scholar, she a commoner; and since I'm only at the beginning of my studies, compared with which they are both proficient I should be punished very reasonably. If there were such people as them to talk about and do anything else like that, I should have to put mine into practice very badly. But what I must remember is that they are only men, not women; and although they may speak ill of me publicly or私下，I am sure they shall be stopped before their words reach my mouth. And besides, even if they did do me any harm, I shouldn't feel need to deal with them publicly. '","He thought: ""My brothers will be punished by their parents as well, why should I bother? It is more likely that I would become distant if I were to take care of this matter myself. Besides, my father is the firstborn, he has no need for a second child, so it's fine with me to look after him. But how can I allow others to speak ill of him behind my back?""","Things are worse than bad in one respect: all the errors of which I might be guilty are to be shared by the rest of the clan, so that there will be no cause for feeling inferior about my own shortcomings. Besides, I am the main source from whom this blame falls, whereas the other boys can evade it because they are only庶子; whereas my being the elder is counting against me. Even if there were no忌讳， my indiscretions could not so easily get out.'","He thought: ""The brothers have parents' instructions, why bother me so much? Besides I am a son of the family, he is a daughter of the family, so we can look at him from behind, and still others talk about him.""","So he began by addressing his younger brothers. 'Both of us will have a father's instructions one way or the other. If we're not careful, our relations could become distant. After all, I am a candidate, and you are a Candidate-out. There is no cause for concern if we don't treat our relations properly; yet it would be very wrong to treat them unfairly. Then there would be others against us to go back on our word with, so I think it best that we should keep our relations correctly treated.","He thought: ""Why should I be so troublesome? It would be too awkward for me. Furthermore, he is my elder brother who has a father, while I am his younger brother with no father, so how could I not look at him as someone with some authority? And then, there will be people behind my back talking about this matter, which I can't even manage.""","They have tutors to discipline them,' he thought; 'why should I go bothering about it? It would be awkward for them, and besides I am the chief one responsible, while there is always talk behind their backs and gossiping. What should I know about self-discipline?'","He thought, ""All my brothers have parents' advice; why should I be so troublesome?

她母亲便连连冷笑道：王琦瑶原来是在坐月子，我倒不知道，她男人都没有，怎么就坐月子，你倒给我说说这个道理！,"Mrs. Wang laughed coldly. 'Oh, so Wang Qiyao should be resting this month, should she? That's funny, I didn't know.

You can tell me this now!""","She delivered cold replies: 'Just now you were talking about how a baby should not be allowed out of bounds while you were pregnant . . .

You know that Wang Guo'er had never been pregnant before she gave birth; I didn't know either; you've just given me a reason for this!""","She gave her ever-latter-year-old a cold laugh: Wang Qiyao had always been having a hard time during the birth of her child; but she had only the previous year been missing from all conversation because her husband hadn't been around.

沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏幕上出现一条平直的绿线，“你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是2.726±0.010K，那个误差是银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。,"As he spoke, Sha typed quickly at the terminal.

轿夫抬轿从街上走，迈的都是八字步，号称“踩街”，这一方面是为讨主家欢喜，多得些赏钱； 另一方面，是为了显示一种优雅的职业风度。,"As the bearers carried their load down the path, their feet left a series of V imprints known as 'tramples' in the dirt, for which satisfied clients usually rewarded them, and which fortified the bearers' pride of profession.","A man lifts a carriage from the street, walking with a straight line as if he were going to go out for a walk, that is, ""to make the guest happy.""

This aspect is intended to please the owner's relatives; it has brought some money.","When bearers carry the dead up the streets, they do the 'eighties' method.

好在吴佩珍是压得起的，她的人生任务不如王琦瑶来得重，有一点吃老本，也有一点不计较，本是一身轻，也是为王琦瑶分担的意思。,"It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her. This was partly because she had plenty of psychic capital to draw on, but also because she simply did not mind. Things came easy to her and she was willing to bear more than her share.","In other words, she is not burdened by her weight. There was a little bit of eating out-of-the-box, too, but there was also a bit of not-hating her, which meant that she had some of the same burden as Ouija's.","Fortunately Wu Peizhen was no weak-hearted woman who could bear any burden, and this allowed Wang Qiyao to focus on her duties as a mother and to accomplish not only her goals but even inspire Wu Peizhen with her successes.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is one who can handle it, for her life task is not as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's, and she has a little of ""not caring"" about things, meaning that she carries herself lightly and also helps Wang Qiuyue.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen can handle it all by herself. She does not have the responsibilities that Wang Qiyao does; in fact, she even gets to be relieved of some of her old-model status. Still, not putting all her energy into things and being unambitious come with their own set of problems—she is both a beneficiary and a contributor to Wang Qiyao's well-being.","In addition, she is not as heavy-weighted as Wang Qi Yuan, who has a life task that is slightly heavier than hers. She eats too much, but also doesn't care about it; this is simply because she is a burden.","There was that: Wu Peizhen was capable; her life task wasn't as serious as Wang Qiyao's, who had barely passed on from generation to generation but still had an aspiration to help Wu Peizhen. That was what gave Wu Peizhen a little bit of grace under pressure. As long as you knew which way the tide, you could at least be grateful.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is one who can bear it, her life mission isn't as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's, she has a little bit of living on past experience, a little bit of not caring about anything, which means that she is carrying a burden for Wang Qiuyue.","At least Wu Peizhen could handle this with her eyes firmly set on the future. She had fewer responsibilities than Wang Qiyao and, while she might not be fully compensated for her sacrifices, she was willing to make no excuses. She was, after all, living off her old capital, and was there to help Wang Qiyao shoulder some of hers.","She is not as heavy as Wang Qi'er, but her life task was not as heavy as Ouyang Qiren's. She had a little bit of old stock, too, and she didn't care about it much either. The essence of her existence was that she shared it with Wang Qi'er."

因见上面大旨不过谈情，亦只是实录其事，绝无伤时诲淫之病，方从头至尾抄写回来，闻世传奇。,He could see that its main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher.,"Because it seems that there is no harm in merely recounting the matter as if it were a piece of news, and no damage to the spirit of love.

It is from the beginning to the end.","But before his eyes could be been proved right, by a hidden message containing a number of cryptic words which seemed to speak of some secret and unsuspected objective, but which nevertheless imparted an intrinsic truthfulness, the original writer confesses without pretence any matter pertaining to love and lust, both above suspicion (for fear of复敌) and below law (for fear of punishment), and sets out what he has captured in an account so far as possible straight to the reader; but not a single word is profanity.

Therefore, I will not repeat this entire work in full back to you.

We have merely copied every word out in full, without omitting any, so that the whole narrative may not, by reason of this censorship, be described as 'anti-tsang', because of the intent to glorify sexual depravity. The story is already copied from above. I heard of this copy-writing from a man who did it for a newsagent at an early stage.","Because what is written above is merely a discussion of love, it is purely factual record, there is no disease of teaching lustful behavior, so I copied it from the beginning to the end, and heard the world's legend.","Everything that appears in this book is genuine.

Therefore, whenever a new opportunity arose, such as playing games of chance with the dogs' time, they let dog-day go to to one of their few adult companions—a neglected older woman called Qing-lian who lived alone.","A family of four who cultivate the land for a living. Because the dog is busy with some business during the day, Liu's wife takes care of the well and grindstone, and the two younger sisters cannot be looked after. Therefore, the old mother of the dog has been taken in by them, living together.","This was of old a family of farmers who did well out of hunting and fishing; but now that the two sons had gone off to make a living elsewhere and Mrs Gou-er's duties of cooking and milking had been taken up by their mother-in-law, Gou-er felt there was too much idle time on his part.

平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。,"There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.","The night in the Peace Village was full of thoughts, but no one could see the large flower on Ouyang Guo's curtains. It just appeared as a shadow. Many thoughts were buried deep inside, like a layer of sand. They all were laboring for survival, extracting oil, cleaning water, crystallizing it into small pieces, how could they ever rise up?","Realizing how difficult it is to find words to express what he was feeling, Wang Qiyao hung up her curtains, making the large flowers on the window frame look like moss; but many of her insecurities were saved from内在的沉渣般一直淤积在心底,成不了形不成大小。","The nights of Peaceful Life were also full of thoughts, but they could not be revealed because there was no big flowers on Wang Qiuyue's curtains. Many thoughts were sunk deep in her heart, just like old dirt. They were all made by life to endure, squeezed out their juice, dried up their water, solidified into blocks, and how they would shake up was not possible.","But even at night peace has many headcases, and among these cases is the repressed desire that one never gets to see in full bloom over the windows, where it would make for a lovely curtain. These repressed desires sink to the bottom of people's hearts, where they are washed away by the currents of ordinary living. Filled with passion as they are with the necessity of making ends meet, those heartcases have evaporated into a stiff, congealed substance, incapable of bubbling to the surface.","In the night of safety, there were many thoughts too. Only the flowers on Wang Guo'er's curtains did not appear. They would have been hard to see without her big curtain covering them. Many thoughts were hidden deep within, like a layer of dirt. All were working to survive through their labor. They would squeeze out all the juice and water, and finally form solid blocks, how could they be stirred up by anything?","Realized? Not all of them were. Wang Qiyao's curtains provided a decent backdrop for the flowers, but many of these thoughts were stuck in her heart—a stew of inertia. The simmering arguments she made were condensed into bits that could have been put on hold until needed.","In the night of peace, there were many thoughts too, but they couldn't be seen because the curtains on Wang Qiuyue's window didn't have big flowers like that. Many thoughts lay deep in her heart, like garbage. All of them were made by life, squeezed out their juices, dried up their water, condensed into blocks, and couldn't rise above a certain level of excitement.","Understandably enough, Peace Lane at night offers up quite a picture; only, there is no large flower like the one on Wang Qiyao's curtain, and the flowers have sunk to the bottom so they do not drown out anything. These repressed thoughts float somewhere in the back of people's minds; when life throws everything against them, they squeeze the juice out, drain the water off, forming pictures of varying sizes and texture, but never able to rise above the stagnation.","The night in the平安里 also contained many thoughts, but there was no big flower on the curtains of Wang Guo'er. It was just a reflection of it. Many thoughts were buried in their hearts, as if they were dried up like a dry sponge. They were all about making life tough, boiling down, purifying, condensing into blocks, how could they be touched up?"

Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.","The courtyard house looks like a sea of brick, crowded together, with lights that seem like grains of sand. While weak, they were dense; as if a pot of soup.","The apartments of these longtang look like a series of parallel stripes, packed so densely that you have to zoom out to see anything beyond the first few or even the last few slivers. The lamps are clusterred, faintly路灯样的光，一直连成网状，什么事情都难以覆盖。","This kind of courtyard houses look like a row of buildings, crowded together, with dim lights here and there, although they are not bright, they form a dense soup.","The tactics of concealment work better in these longtang where every house looks to be built right next door; where lamps flicker in the darkness, contributing to an enveloping soup of light.","This courtyard house looks like a cluster of bricks with its windows jam-packed tightly together, with the light being faint but dense. It was like a bowlful of soup.","The shells of these longtang buildings look like a mesh of connection—crisscrossing toward each other, they seem to converge onto nothing at times, but however dense the mixture may be, you never can tell until you try.","This alley house looks like a row of slum houses, crowded together, with dim lights that flicker like beans. Though weak, they form a dense mass.","Even so, these Shanghai-style longtang seem to be everywhere crowded; their buildings appear so close one might think they were built in the same batch.

薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。,"'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.","Then I would not have been surprised if they had not come to disturb me: for my birthday is on the 12th of this month; but how can I know that they did not come here? The length is so long, the texture is so fine, and the flavor is so sweet. There are a large, round fruit; a very big, round country; there are huge, round fish.""","I hope you weren't aware that I was afraid of inviting you to my birthday dinner,' said Shi-Bao. 'I have no reason for expecting you to come, if it be to eat a bunch of ripe fish and a batch of hard candy, or a batch of powdered blue sugar on three, or a lengthwise long like tangrees, or so thick and such large like these Persian oranges as you've brought from Bao-chai's and Mr. Cheng's.","Wang Zhepu said, ""I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been forced. It was on the thirtieth of this month that my birthday was. I didn't know that those two old men had come looking for me. They were so fat, so long, tender, fresh lotus roots; such a big watermelon; they were as long as these elephants' heads and as big as a whole elephant's head. And also there was the incense of the Elephant Country.""","I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't for the fact that it's my birthday,' said Xue Pan. 'I heard they were going to get some fresh coles from Old Hu and Old Cheng. And then I heard they'd brought this big bunch of Thai sugar cane sugar candy, and some of those long, fat Thai pigs and fish.'","Zhang Bao said that he was afraid of being upset, but not because he was so young; instead, it was because he didn't know where his friends, Long Han and Chen Ge, had come from. So they were thin, long, and delicate, and they were fresh vegetables like green pepper and large mangoes; so huge, so big, and fragrant, as if they were coming from a country called Thailand.","I hope it's because,' said Xiang Pan, 'that you haven't forgotten me on this occasion. You would find out very soon what your friends have brought you: a big length of lightly spun pure jade-curd cake; a large bunch of long, thin plump pear cakes; a large bunch of the long, long mangoes from where your journeyman baker can find anything at bargain-price; some fragrant sweet corncake; and, above all, two long, tall chillies grown from the fruits of a new Government plantation in Thailand.","Wang Zhepan said: ""I don't dare to disturb it unless I do so. Only because there were two old men here - one named Luo Hou and the other was called Cheng - they came up with this huge piece of fresh lotus root, such a big watermelon, and this giant elephant from Siam.""","I wouldn't have disturbed you if I hadn't been sure of your instant attention! It all starts on the thirteenth. Third Wednesday of the month. Now look: This beautiful fresh coconut pie! And look at the nice firm, ripe coconuts! And look at that lovely big pearl-white ear of暹逻王的 pork, so perfectly shaped and cut! And look at the crystal-clear fish from that far-off country called Thailand! Just wait until the twenty-first! That's the day I give my birthday feast.'","Then I would not have been alarmed at all if it were not for my birthday; because on the 10th of next month is my birthday, and what can we say about our father-in-law and uncle-uncle? This is a large piece of raw ginger, this is a long piece of fresh fruit, this is a big piece of sweet melon; and this is a huge piece of a pineapple; and this is a huge piece of a fish."""

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her, she has not been silent about her grievances, while Mr. Chen's head was on the table as a hundred promises and vows were written for him. Yet, when he joined the state-owned enterprise, his properties became part of the national government, which meant that he had earned a heaven-sent blessing from heaven and earth. The dream of owning a private villa turned into a shadow at the garden apartment.","She didn't mind venting her frustrations, but Mr. Cheng had stricken out a million promises for the state and millions for the private pocket, and now their company was public property and they couldn't look back on their own fortunes—a beautiful garden and splendid apartment in their private mansion would have been worth more than anything.","For this she had often complained, Mr. Yin had made a thousand vows on his pillow, all promises made, but when the public ownership of property was forced upon him, he could not retain even one room, and it was like a dream that the garden house had become a mere illusion.","She got upset enough to make Wang Qiyao swear that if he didn't give up his hobby, he'd offer the entire apartment to her—only to find that at the end of the day, state ownership meant the same thing as state blessing, and even if Madame Yan had won half of the property, it would have been a dead end.","For her, there was no shortage of complaining; Mr. Chen also wrote a thousand words of wishes on his pillow and made promises that he would not let anything happen to the country, but it happened that the state was merged with the private sector and the property had been handed over to the state.","She didn't mind quarrelling about how Mr. Chen's bed was missed; she'd promised she wouldn't let it continue, but Mr. Cheng himself had decided to combine his private business with public works and sold the whole lot to the State for a sum of money. The result was that he had been able to stay in his private garden and mansion even though the whole place had been acquired by the State for public purposes.","In order to make her mad, he had made a thousand promises and vows on his pillow, but when the public ownership of enterprises was established, all his private property became nationalized. He could only save a small piece of land as a token of gratitude. The garden and villa were finally turned into a mirage.","She got so that, on some occasions, she even heard Mr. Yan complain about her—how would he get rid of the bed, the bedside table, the wardrobe?—and now, upon the advent of state-owned enterprise and the great great purge of personal properties for the benefit of the state, all was well: She had kept a small patch of ground where she could tuck herself in bed at night and cry herself to sleep.","She did not mind her frustration; she was a part of the plan when Mr. Chen put down his head on the floor and made his own vows. He had also promised that he would not let it be, but now he found out that public-private partnerships were taking place, so what could she do? To save one house is like getting heaven and earth, and the garden apartment will become a memory at last."

韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。,The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.,"Wu Xiaowang walked up with a strong will, his pain could be endured for what seemed like hours.

看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I was thinking of something pleasant inside my heart. There was a little bit of desire in my mind. I also had some fondness for them. They were standing far away from me, but they couldn’t hear what was going on there. They were lying down in one position, sitting up in another position, and then leaning forward and then turning around. Then, she was laying half way between the two sides, with her head hanging over the ground. She was wearing a thin sleepwear that covered her body, which had been torn by the bed. The bed was slightly wrinkled, too.","But her curiosity was piqued, even though she had little desire for this new discovery. Because they were far from where and because the women weren't listening to the noise around them, the women in the dark couldn't hear what was going on; but a woman in a bed-suit of that sort lying on her side appeared at one moment with its head tilted up, another with its body hanging over the edge of the bed, and another with his half-conscious figure above the rim of the bed, also hanging almost to the floor. There was a hint of rigidity in the translucent sleepers as their bodies changed positions. The wrinkles on the walls were beginning to irritate the amateur restorer of underwear.","She seemed pleased with her own appearance, but also a little bored by it. She was standing far enough away from them not to hear what they were saying, but she could see that there was a woman lying on her bed, in different positions: some of which involved lying on one side, others on her back, while one leg was extended out onto the floor. Her dress was transparent, so she looked like a ghost. The bed was already wrinkled, so she didn't look very clean.","But though they were happy with their arrangement, this girl was a bit frustrated. They stood far away so that they could hear nothing of the going on in the bedroom; they could see, however, the woman lying back on the bed, her several positions, the one at least half sitting up, the other half hanging to the side of the bed, her transparent robe curling around her body, the bed already looking worn out.","I was a little happy to see them, but I still had some lingering feelings for them. Because they were far away, their voices couldn't be heard from where they stood. They were lying down in various positions, one position was sitting up, another was leaning forward, and one was lying on her back. The other half of her body was lying on the ground. There were also two legs that were bent over at the waist. The bed was slightly wrinkled as well.","But her curiosity about their conversation—though she was still some distance from where they were—had begun to tango—and there was so much about the床上的人—women of various ages and descriptions, wearing warm garments for different purposes—whose faces she could not see, standing with their heads bent, a full body raised up on one's bedside, the damp corners of which she could feel—it seemed to have a slightly toying quality that reminded her of a cloth罩着自己的身体，也使她对其中某物的一份心绪有一点发腻。","She felt a bit of happiness as well as some lust for them standing far away. She could not hear what was said there because they were too far from her. She saw that there was a woman wearing a sleep robe lying on her bed. She lay down in different positions – side to side, back to front, and even half way down. Her transparent robe covered her body. The bed had already wrinkled.","But as they stood off a bit, it started to feel a bit monotonous; besides, they couldn't hear what they were talking about, since all the voices merged together into one sound. They could only make out a woman's voice talking to herself as she lay in bed, and the other women acted out various positions: front, side, back. One had the woman lying on her side; another had her on her back; and yet another had just occupied half of the bed while the other half dangled to the floor. Her sleep mask completely covered her body, which was visible through the half-transparent coverlet. The bed was creased, and the whole scene was a bit boring.","I am thinking of her heart a little too much, and there is something on my tongue that I cannot help but feel. They stand so far away from me, and they can't hear what's going on around them, just as one woman sits on the bed with a shawl over her head, and she changed positions every time, for example, when she was lying sideways, or standing up and looking at the ceiling, or even when she was half way down on the floor. She had a thin sleeping robe covering her body, the bed was already sagging, which reminded me of how old it was."

Remember: if you marry into a family, you will do as they do; if you娶 a wife, you will be a good husband to her and your children will be fed.
