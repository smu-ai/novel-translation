虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother has been a symbol of harmony with him in the rice fields of high mountainous East China, I still had a part in the solemn ceremony that he had created, which was also his father in the half pain and half happiness of his life. However, even though she was pregnant with both my guilt and crime, but it was actually her grandfather who was married to her in the formal manner, which was always in the form of marriage, as well as randomness and instability, and so, when writing about then, I referred to him as ""Mr. Zhou Youhong"" more accurately.","Although she was still a virgin on her wedding day, Grandma had already been married with him as one of the few two-thirds of the village's noble families. The fact that she was married at all was not because of my father; it was simply because she had been born into the village where the sun set, where the river flowed, and where the moon hung over the fields.","Despite my grandmother's peaceful cohabitation with him in the field of sorghum, at that solemn period of pain and happiness, my grandmother, who was also pregnant with my crime and virtue, still remained a father from the north-east of Huimo despite being a single mother married by marriageable. At that time, my grandmother was a single mother married by marriage, and I had no dowry. My father hadn't settled down yet, so when writing about those times, I should still call him Yu Qianbao.","Although Grandma was with him in the sorghum field like a phoenix and together they were happy but also suffering, it is true that she had carried my father's guilt and half-hearted love for her, but at that time she was still a single wife of Mr. Qiu's and therefore not yet the official bride of the Northern Plains. Even though I had not fallen down the earth yet, Granddad was not yet a man who could be considered a husband and so I should have called him Yu Zhan'ao."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy.

That would sell.'","He was delighted, saying, ""Well, I think you'd better put a pig on your face; no one will pay for it, so why not just put a pig? It's sure to be good business.""","He was delighted with his idea. 'Well,' he said, 'I'll put a few pigs on my right cheek. Maybe someone will buy them out of their own pockets.'","He was very pleased and said, ""Well, I'll carve a pile of dung on my right side. Nobody will buy it, so let's just carve a pig. It is fat and stupid. That should be good.""","He was pleased with himself for this suggestion.

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","On both sides of the road, the grain fields are stacked like bricks, unable to separate themselves and look at each other, grayish-white high粱穗子睁着眼睛不敢分辨，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区分，永远无法终止，好像源源不断的流水。","The stalks of sorghum were held together like a massive column by dense layers of soil, their branches stretching out in all directions.

She identified it immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more, taking out on Bao-yu's unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses.","It is a bit of a coincidence that Queen Anne is listening to the tea party today and overhearing some of the complaining from behind her back, so she knows that Miss Maud has become ill and needs to go on sick leave this week.

Even Madame Yan, who usually wore her heart on her sleeve, retained certain secrets that she herself might not have understood.

But then he couldn't help thinking that, as a member of the Taoist Order, he should have been able to do these things. If they didn't like him, he'd just have to go back to his old job.","Wu Xiaopai wanted to ask him what was a God’s Hall Point and a Widing Jump Point, how to point them out, or how to unblock them. But turning it over in his mind, he was a Qingmiao Tang Master and the disciple of the Grandmaster, so even if he could not do it himself, he would be embarrassed by subordinates. Besides, dealing with a little girl was not difficult at all. He nodded and said, “I know.”","What's a 'godfather's'穴? What's the 'ringing-point'?' he asked, but thought better of asking about those things because he was the Master of the Yellow Wood Hall and the leader of the Helmsman Society; he wouldn't know how to do such things himself.

Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","Afternoon, it was just in the afternoon when they had been taking shots for hours; this hour was left empty. It was only them that were sitting facing each other. They both sat there without speaking. The summer morning’s sleep hadn’t completely disappeared yet, and she couldn’t help but let out a few whiffs of breath as she lay on her back. She felt like she was talking about nothing at all.","In the afternoon, when they came for their shots, it was usually around three o'clock. There was no time left for them to sit at a table together; she and I were the only two there. We sat silently and listened to each other, still trying to get through the afternoon's fatigue before we fell asleep. The summer afternoon had not yet completely passed, so we all got up early with our minds clear. We tried to talk but could hardly find anything to say.","The afternoon dose was always taken around 3 or 4 o'clock, leaving a one hour gap that they filled up with each other. The summer sleep still hadn't passed completely, so she couldn't help yawning as if her eyes were dry from not being used enough. They forced themselves to keep their spirits up and didn't even know what they had said. There were crickets chirping on the branches of a willow tree, and it sounded like ""wheee-whee"" which was unclear.","By four or five in the afternoon they'd come for their shots. There was always a break of time between them; only they sat there facing each other. The summer sleepiness hadn't yet passed completely, so they couldn't help yawning all the time. They had to struggle to keep themselves awake. The cicadas on the tree branches outside were buzzing loudly and clearly enough, but still it wasn't clear what they said."

因问周瑞家的道：“这老老不知用了早饭没有呢？”,She turned to Zhou Rui's wife.

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","As for Zhou Rui, he already guessed a little bit of what was coming. Because he had been thinking about this matter since his father-in-law had bought land back then. Now, seeing how Liu Tong has done so, he could not help but feel that he was in his heart. He said, ""Old Old you can relax.","Wang Rui's wife then knew what she was thinking; for he had been a little too bold when he told her that his father had bought land from his old friend Liu. Now that he saw him now doing so, it seemed impossible to ignore the fact that he would be showing off his good looks by saying something like this. She smiled at him and said, 'Don't worry about me.","Zhou Rui’s listened, already guessed what his intentions were. He knew that his husband had won the land purchases in the past by his father’s help. Seeing Liu Lao’s current state of affairs, he couldn’t resist him. He said with a smile, “Old old, you can rest assured.”","Zhou Rui's wife guessed that this must be a request for help on her husband's behalf. He had once bought a piece of land with his father-in-law's money and Zhou Rui was afraid he might refuse; but she thought it would also be good for her own reputation if she showed that she could manage things properly. So she said, 'Well, you needn't worry about it."

Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","She did not waste any time complaining about her private life or expressing her wishes for the country's industries; she made many promises that would be bestowed upon her by her husband, but unfortunately this was not what happened, leaving her with a single house, which is considered heaven and earth.","She complained about how much she had been dissatisfied with her husband's treatment of her. But when he decided that he was going to merge his company with the state-owned one, all her complaints were forgotten. She was now left holding onto a piece of land belonging to the government, which she could not protect, but it would be ruined by the fact that she had no place to live in any case.","For this reason she didn’t stop complaining, and Mr. Duan made a thousand vows on his pillow, and a million promises, but when public ownership was introduced, all the property belonged to the state. She could save one private room as a heaven and earth’s grace, and the garden house would eventually become a mirage.","She often complained about this.

Another time she was lying sideways, and then turned to face the ceiling and curled herself up again. She had been wrapped in her soft, transparent robe, which was beginning to sag under her weight.","She looked a little pleased but also a bit lusty as she watched them from afar. She could not hear what was said because they were too far away, so she could only see one woman lying on her back with several different positions: side, head up, half body on the ground, and another half on the bed. Her transparent nightgown covered her body and the bed was already wrinkled.","The sight of this scene made me a little bit happier than usual and also a bit more bored.
