虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother is also a harmonious couple with him on his side of the rice field, and in that solemn and solemn period where they were both sorrowful and happy together, I do not have any charge, but it was indeed a proud father of the highland East of the Northern Plains, but then it was just a single man's marriage ceremony as a wedding partner, and there was quite a degree of randomness and instability. Moreover, I did not come from soil yet, so I called him ""Luo Xue Qing"" more accurately when writing about the things at that time.","Even though my grandma had already been blossoming in the sorghum fields under the direction of her father, who was a single man from Northeast Gaomi Township, where she was a married man who at once shared pain with me and at the same time compensated Granddad for his crime, she still held a certain elegance and refined refinement in those highland northeast villages where, when the soil rested on her head, she was a married wife who, having been adopted, felt at once relief and annoyance toward my grandfather. Also, despite the fact that he hadn't born any children, by which time it was already possible to call him Cousin Amtu more appropriately.","Although my grandmother had been harmoniously married with him in the field of corn, she was still happily pregnant at that time, but despite her being a half-dirty, half-fortunate father, I should call her a single house wife who was engaged in marriage by the family. My grandfather had been married to her as well, so it was not very stable or fixed, and even though my father hadn’t fallen off the earth yet, I shouldn’t use his name.","Even though Grandma had consummated her love for Yu Cang in the sorghum field, reaching harmony and happiness, she remained a half-crazed, half-cursed child born of a father who walked among the gourd fields of Northeast Gaomi Township — a man who, like his father before him, had been tied to his wife and loved unconditionally. But Grandma was not a virgin; she had not fallen into debt to society. So, even when it came time to write about this period in her life, I called her by the name of her father, Yu Cang."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was delighted. He said, ""Ah, just a pile of dung on the right face, no one will pay for that, so why not carve a pig? It's very expensive but it will surely make money.""","I'm markedly pleased, he said, munching on some cow dung, 'So I think I'd prefer to draw a cow on the right face instead of one of stupid pigs--that's what I've been told.'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Well, I'll carve a pile of dung on my left side, as no one will pay for it. Why not try something else? A pig would be nice – fat and stupid.""","All right,' he said, 'I'll put some on the right cheek. Now, there's a job for someone who wants something done. Maybe no one will buy any, but maybe they will want a pig. Pigs are big and stupid, so it should be a money-making job.'"

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","On both sides of the road, there is a layer of brown stalks, tightly intertwined and unbreakable. They crowd together and stare at each other, grayish-white stalks that do not have any difference with one another. The high粱穗子毫无办法分辨彼此，每一穗都充满活力，仿佛潺潺流水一样。","The sorghum was a dense layer of strong, unyielding walls, so impenetrable that they could not even tell the distinction between two rows—seagreen stalks sleepingely unaware of each other. The river's course seemed to go on for ever.","On either side of the road, the tall corn was blocky and static. It formed a solid mass, with each grain looking at every other one. The green corn stalks were still asleep, unable to distinguish themselves from their neighbors. Corn grew without end, like a flowing river.","The lines of sorghum along the road, solid and rigid like blocky building blocks, squeezed together for added stability, provided no clues as to whether they ended or not. The stalks contained no distinction between one another, nor could you tell from looking at them that they grew in an endless stream."

东北乡地势低洼，往往秋水泛滥，高粱高秆防涝，被广泛种植，年年丰产。,"Northeast Gaomi Township is largely swampy land that is flooded by autumn rains; but since the tall sorghum stalks resist waterlogging, it was planted everywhere and invariably produced a bumper crop.","The northern town has lowland terrain and often floods in spring, with high粱杆子防洪， widely planted, year after year.","The northeast had low land, and on average, during the fall rains, the swampy ground overflowed and the sorghum plants died of rot, making the whole field fail. Year after year they produce plenty, therefore.","The northeastern region is low-lying with flooded fields during autumn.

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes.

'You're not different from the people on Three Body All Born To Live In The Real World,' he said. 'We aren't like the ordinary people; we're top-class individuals. Three Body isn't only for those who know about scientific facts and mathematics—being able to understand concepts at that sublimacy of knowledge requires a true genius.'","He had changed his usual dirty homeless man look on TV, now he was dressed up in a suit, looking elegant, ""We are similar to you guys, we are all elites. ‘Three body’ is for your kind of people. Its contents and意境, ordinary people can’t understand; knowledge needed to play it is at a high level and its depth is also beyond what common people could have.""","He changed back to a clean-shaven street bum as usual, but this time with a difference: a suit and tie. His new appearance gave him a refined air. 'You are probably right,' he said, his voice carrying a certain aura of authority. 'As the Three Body was prepared for the elite, it is a must for us. The depth of meaning and the sophisticated mind required by the game are above the understanding of common people.'"

这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。,"It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.","The people who claim they are the ""Master of香气"" are simply making up their own nonsense by saying things like ""We have no idea what your will is, but we must obey it"".

Once he is satisfied, all responsibility for the actions that will follow falls on Trinket. From then on it is up to him how far they go."

父亲，一九五七年，你躲在我家里间屋里那个地洞里时，你每日每夜，在永恒的黑暗中，追忆流水年月，你至少三百六十次想到了我们家那几十间房屋的屋盖在大火中塌落的情景。 你想到你的父亲我的爷爷在那时刻想到了什么，我的幻想紧追着你的幻想，你的幻想紧追着爷爷的思维。,"Father, when you were hiding in the burrow we dug for you in the floor of my home back in 1957, you recalled those days of your past in the unrelenting darkness. On no fewer than 365 occasions, in your mind you saw the roof of your house crash down amid the flames, and wondered what was going through the mind of your father, my granddad. So my fantasies were chasing yours while yours were chasing Granddad's.","Father, in 1957, when you hid me in my home's attic that night, I kept remembering the scenes of the fire from our house's thirty rooms every day. I thought about what my father my grandfather thought about the situation at that time.

You've dreamed that your father Mr Li didn't think about how our houses had collapsed due to the大火. You have continued to think about his thought until it was finally realized by your grandfather.","Father, in September of 1957, you were hiding in my mother's room cellar, where you spent every night in eternal darkness recalling our family's houses that had been destroyed by fire. You dreamed about what your father, my grandfather, was thinking at that moment, while my imagination followed yours, and then your imagination followed mine.","In 1957, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you hid in one of the tunnels in my house. Every night you, Father, traced your thoughts back to the thousands of rooms in our estate that had burned to the ground during the uprising. How many times did you think, Father?

下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","In the afternoon, when it is time for injections, there is often a gap of about 30 minutes between two injections. This is all empty, just her and I, sitting side by side. The summer has not yet fully gone, and she can’t help but groggy. Summer evenings have left us exhausted, and she cannot help but groggy. She has not quite recovered from the morning nap, which still hasn’t completely passed. It is impossible to tell what was said during the night.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early in the three o'clock time frame. While the hour was empty, a hour or two left free, the girls would stand idly by with their arms encrossled over their heads. Summer illness had yet to work its way away, and they caught odd glances from deadchairs桐树上的蝉吱吱地鸣叫着。 Nobody knew what to say.","They came for shots around 4 or so in the afternoon. This hour was always empty. It was just them two, sitting face to face. The summer sleep had not fully passed, they could not help yawning all the time. They tried to stay awake, but they did not know what they were saying. The cicadas on the branches of a crape myrtle kept calling, it sounded like ""wha-wha-who"".","They usually came in at three or four in the afternoon, leaving the studio empty for them two women, face to face. At that hour, with the困倦刚刚过去的午睡效应, they would begin to feel sleepy, and would yawn, over and over. They tried hard to keep their eyes open, but the cicadas from the walnut tree outside seemed unable to restrain themselves and continued to chirp, their voices growing louder as they moved up the stem of the tree."

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","The man who heard this said that he had guessed a few things from what was said. Because of his father-in-law's ability to buy land from him many times, now seeing how much his old father-in-law has bought, he felt quite pleased with his own thoughts; also, he wanted to show off his own dignity. He laughed and said, ""Old old you are so free!","By this she could almost tell what the old lady had in view. It was because, during one of his last fights with the village丈人, Grannie Liu had secured a field by means of climbing over their heads, Trinket had needed to raise such strength; and that Grannie Lui had succeeded in forcing them all out, but having made good their损失， so that they could and would like to congratulate each other on their brave deed. Sarcasm being available for play, she gave the寡妇一个承诺，她说：老老你放心，我绝没有向外边去找的意思。","Wang Ru’s ears perked up when she heard this. She knew that the old man wanted to buy a piece of land, but he had received help from her husband’s father in the past. Hearing that the old man was now willing to do so, Wang Ru felt no difficulty about it. Furthermore, she also wanted to show off her dignity. She said with a smile, ""Old man, rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife immediately guessed that her visit was connected with the quarrel about the fields, which she had heard so much about; but she realized presently that it was a more complicated business than this, because the old woman's father had been involved in the transaction; and having now seen her in person, she was gratified at being able to satisfy him her sincerity in coming. 'Old colour, I say! You can rely on us!"
他也想去赶街，可是不到放我们回去的时候，让我们呆在这里无人看管，又不合规定。,"He also wanted to go to the market, but it wasn't time to release us yet and leaving us unattended was against the rules.","He too wants to run a street, but it won’t be safe for us to return until we have finished paying our fare at the market. It’s also not in line with the regulations.","He had wanted to go down to the market, but he must not have been aware that they would let us stay for a while so that someone else could come in to look after us, since there were other rules about staying overnight.","He wants to go out for a walk too, but we have not been sent back yet. We can't be left here without supervision, which is against the rules.","He also wanted to go out on the street, but didn't get past the screen. Not only was it after their release time, but it also didn't fit our purpose."

Then he heard the flip-ploy of cloth boots again. He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty. 'Laurel! Laurel!' It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway.","Only what he was doing is just standing there with a lot of food on the table; he took some pieces, and heard the footsteps coming from the floor, but it seemed that he wasn't coming from Little Quanxiang. He thought first of entering the table below before talking about it, but then he heard Little Quanxiang say, ""Little Chuanshan, Little Chuanshan!""""","A voice asked from under the table, 'Crimson child from before!'

It burned all night long before it finally died down. They do not know how many houses were burnt during this period of time.","That side of the village was all enclosed by palissades of bamboo and some sort of palisading material that resembled willows rather than stones; counting them all together, it is not surprising that a place where such material burns so fiercely should quickly be extinguished, thanks to the assistance of military and common folk. When the smoke from this blaze died out after yet another day's奋战, it is hard to imagine how many houses had been burned already."

潘寒露出神秘的笑容说：“不错，但假如构成计算机的三千万个士兵，每个人在一秒钟内可以挥动黑白小旗十万次，总线上的轻骑兵的奔跑速度是几倍音速甚至更快，结果就不一样了。,"Pan gave a mysterious smile. 'You're right. But suppose that of the thirty million soldiers forming the computer, each one is capable of raising and lowering the black and white flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster.

The results wouldn't be exactly the same.""","Pan smiled triumphantly. 'That doesn't underestimate the difficulty of constructing a computer from three million soldiers. If each soldier in the army could have fired a color flag every second, the speed of a million troops would be much faster than the sound of a typical horse running at four times the speed of sound—different indeed.","Pan Han smiled mysteriously and said, ""That’s right, but if a million soldiers were assembled to form a computer, each of them could swing their black-and-white flags 100,000 times per second, and the speed of the light cavalry would be several times the speed of sound or even faster. The result would be different.""","Pan smiled神秘地。 'No, but if so... let's say there are three million soldiers in our computer. And each of them waves its black-and-white flag a thousand times per second. Then the speed of the horseless trains running on the network is several times the speed of sound or even faster. The result would be different."

好在吴佩珍是压得起的，她的人生任务不如王琦瑶来得重，有一点吃老本，也有一点不计较，本是一身轻，也是为王琦瑶分担的意思。,"It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her.

It was on the thirtieth of this month that my birthday was. I didn't know that those two old men had come looking for me.

Yet, when he joined the state-owned enterprise, his properties became part of the national government, which meant that he had earned a heaven-sent blessing from heaven and earth. The dream of owning a private villa turned into a shadow at the garden apartment.","She didn't mind venting her frustrations, but Mr. Cheng had stricken out a million promises for the state and millions for the private pocket, and now their company was public property and they couldn't look back on their own fortunes—a beautiful garden and splendid apartment in their private mansion would have been worth more than anything.","For this she had often complained, Mr. Yin had made a thousand vows on his pillow, all promises made, but when the public ownership of property was forced upon him, he could not retain even one room, and it was like a dream that the garden house had become a mere illusion.","She got upset enough to make Wang Qiyao swear that if he didn't give up his hobby, he'd offer the entire apartment to her—only to find that at the end of the day, state ownership meant the same thing as state blessing, and even if Madame Yan had won half of the property, it would have been a dead end."

看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set.

She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I was thinking of something pleasant inside my heart. There was a little bit of desire in my mind. I also had some fondness for them.

There was a hint of rigidity in the translucent sleepers as their bodies changed positions. The wrinkles on the walls were beginning to irritate the amateur restorer of underwear.","She seemed pleased with her own appearance, but also a little bored by it. She was standing far enough away from them not to hear what they were saying, but she could see that there was a woman lying on her bed, in different positions: some of which involved lying on one side, others on her back, while one leg was extended out onto the floor. Her dress was transparent, so she looked like a ghost. The bed was already wrinkled, so she didn't look very clean.","But though they were happy with their arrangement, this girl was a bit frustrated. They stood far away so that they could hear nothing of the going on in the bedroom; they could see, however, the woman lying back on the bed, her several positions, the one at least half sitting up, the other half hanging to the side of the bed, her transparent robe curling around her body, the bed already looking worn out."
