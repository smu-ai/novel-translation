虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother was already a high-crop farmer's daughter in the spirit of harmony with him in the solemn period where he had been born on the half-burdened and half-pleasure of his life, even though she had also given birth to my guilt and righteousness, but that was still a son-in-law from the prosperous Eastman clan generation of the Qing dynasty, who was indeed fatherless and single motherhood at that time, yet I did not know how much her father was attached to me, so when I wrote about those things then, I called him ""Remi"" more accurately than ""Liu Qiuxin"".","Even though she was now pregnant, Grandma had been high schooler at the time. Since that moment she had entered into a love affair with my crime, both tragic and gloriously extravagant. For that matter, she had been the bride of the Zhang family, the maiden-in-waitting of my marriage, and therefore, since my father had not yet set foot on land, we called her Remi's little girl. More importantly than that, the topic of discussion about those days was never referred to as Yu Zhan'ao: it remained purely arbitrary. And finally, even my father, who had not yet left the fork of the mountain, could hardly be called随意的，因为他的存在只能从外人看来。","Although my grandmother was at peace with him among the millet fields, in that solemn process of cohabitation marked by pain and happiness, although she was also carrying half a load of my sins and virtues, after all, she was still the father of the Fengjia County, the noble bride of the Northern Plains, but then, my grandmother was only the single housewife who was married by arrangement; her husband and she were more or less free and accidental. Moreover, my father hadn't yet fallen into the ground, so when I wrote about those events, I still called him Yu Quanliao more accurately.","Even though Great-Grandma had consummated her love for Father in the sorghum field, and although she had, with half pain, half pleasure, become a clear-cut marriage partner of the single Wang clan head, it was still Father who fathered my current existence, even though he hadn't quite lost his footing in society. So when I came to write about this time in his life, I continued to refer to him as Yu Zhan'ao. He was still a very effective name.","Although my grandmother had already achieved a harmonious union with him amidst the millet fields, in that process of half pain and half joy, and she had also conceived my father, who was indeed a product of the romantic era of Gaomi's Northeastern County, but at that time, my grandmother was the legally married wife of Grandfather. Their union, while occurring within the boundaries of tradition, was characterized by a certain degree of spontaneity, chance, and instability. Moreover, my father had not yet been buried, so when writing about events up to that point, referring to him as Yu Zhanao is more accurate.","Even though Grandma had already lain with Daddy鳌 in the sorghum field, and although she was already carrying his child, she was still legally married to Shan Qiang, and their union, however painful it may have been for Grandma, was still only semi-h神圣. Moreover, Father hadn't yet been buried in the ground, so when it came to writing about those days, it was more accurate to call him Yu Zhan'ao.","Even though Grandma had reached a understanding with Feng, she was still the wife of a man from a wealthy family in Northeast Gaomi, and although she had consented to a de facto union with Granddad, it was an arrangement that could have been terminated at any time by either of them. Moreover, Father was not yet settled, so it would have been more accurate to call him Yu Zhan'ao."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was delighted: ""Yes, a lot of people would rather not pay for the dung on their right cheeks than to carve a pig, which is much more tasty but also smarter.""","Good!' he said. 'From left to right, the face says cattle. No one's going to spend money on a buffalo to etch a 'horse' with. I think, then, that we'd better start selling chicken skins instead.'","He was very pleased and said, ""Hmm, I'll carve some dung on the right side of my face. No one will pay for it because they don't want to buy dung. Why not carve a pig? It's fat and stupid. I'm sure that will be a good business.""","That'll show them!' he said, as he set about刻着一排牛粪。 'A pig, fatter and bigger than anything you've ever seen! That's sure to do me more business than a cow.'","He was quite pleased with himself, saying, ""Well, carving a face full of cow dung on the right side is fine, but no one pays for cow dung. It's better to carve a pig instead; it's fat and stupid, so the business will surely do well.""","Then again, ' he said, 'if I刻 a big pile of cowshit on my right cheek, I'd never get anyone to pay money for it. Better carve a pig. They're fat and stupid. I'll sell a lot of them.'",He sounded very pleased with himself. 'I know. A pig's trotters. No one's going to want a pile of cow-pat. But a pig's trotter now—now that's a different matter. Pork is what they'll want. And a pig's trotter is a clever idea. I'm sure it will sell.'

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","On each side of the road, rows of tall rice stalks stand like pillars, interlocking, filling up with space, gazing at one another, gray-green stalks of rice waiting for a glance.

可巧凤姐正在上房算了输赢帐，听见后面一片声嚷，便知是李嬷嬷老病发了，又值他今儿输了钱，迁怒于人，排揎宝玉的丫头。,"Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia's room totting up the day's scores for the final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment.

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes. 'You're just like I imagined. Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.'","He has become a different man on the media scene, wearing a suit and tie, displaying a gentlemanly air, “You’re not that much like me; you’re elite types, so I’m preparing your kind for this book series, its contents and意境，common people cannot understand it; it requires you to acquire knowledge at such a high level and a deep content.”","With newfound professionalism, he walked onto the stage in a pair of pants and shoes that smelled of torn cloth but appeared elegant as night and day with the media's usual haggard look.

The knowledge required to play it reaches a high level and encompasses deep content that is not something ordinary people can possess.""","He was a complete opposite of the dirty old man he usually was on media appearances. In his suit and tie, he appeared very sophisticated. 'I imagine you are all elite. Three Body was made for people like you. The concepts and themes in the book are too deep for the average person to understand. The level of knowledge required to play the game is too high for most.'","He had abandoned his dirty, down-at-the-heel appearance and dressed in a suit of leather shoes.

这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。,"It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.","These people speak of themselves as masters of the fragrance, and often talk about waiting for their master’s instructions, which is all part of a plan they have been working out all along. However, when it comes time to say “I consent” or agree with something, they tend to forget that they already know what to do, so instead of being hesitant, they simply go ahead and do whatever they want, regardless of whether or not it aligns with their own plans.","These off-duty masters like to crow their new beloved's glory, but all they do is wait for him to order them what to make. Already long before their meetings, in fact, every one of them had a plan in mind and was waiting for its execution to be carried out. All they wanted was for someone else to agree with his that they should not take part in any important matter. In this way their roles would never grow too great.","These people spoke of themselves as the master of incense, and constantly said things like ""waiting for the will of the master of incense,"" but in their hearts they had already made up their minds what to do. All they needed was the approval of the master of incense, and then they would not be held responsible for any serious consequences.","These Helmsman-songs all bowed up front and claimed their lofty title with reverent phrases like 'Waiting for my chief's instructions'. But whatever it was they had in mind, all they really wanted was the green-light from their leader. So they made him the hero: any decisions they made had only to be referred back to him for approval, and thereafter they could not take responsibility for them.","These people, who call themselves ""incense masters"" with their mouths, and spout all sorts of things like 'waiting for the incense master's instructions', in reality, each one has their own plans in their hearts, just hoping to get their approval. Thus, they push everything onto Brother Incense, so that in the future they won't bear major responsibilities.","These people would stand respectfully at the door calling him 'Elder' and all the time they were thinking, 'He won't give us any trouble if we do this; it'll all get laid at his door. He won't have to worry about it; it won't involve him in any major obligations.'","These men introduced themselves as 'the Master' and, whatever their true intentions, spouted nonsense about awaiting his orders. In fact, each had by now made up his own mind what he wanted to do, but was waiting for his approval before carrying out his plan — knowing that, once he had his imprimatur, he could wash his hands of all responsibility for the consequences."

韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'","Qian Xiaobang wanted to know what the “Shengtong Temple” and “Cangping穴” were, how to point them out, and what to do with them, but then he thought, I am a master of the Shengtong Temple, as well as the head of the General’s Pavilion, and even though I cannot point or dislocate these points, wouldn’t it be too bad for my subordinates if they look down on me? In fact, dealing with a little girl is not that difficult. He nodded his head and said: “Yes.”","Trinket began to ask the young man questions about the spots, but as he reflected on it, he realized that he was actually the Misty Tower practitioner who had brought the old eunuch with him when he came to China—whether or not this girl in front of him was any less important than their Green Wood Headmaster and his younger brother—and that it would be no trouble for him to cure her of anything he might want to know. Besides, there were so many younger eunuchs in the Palace, none of whom could really be considered a 'expert' enough to treat a 'prince' like Trinket, and he should never try to put his senior down. So he decided to say nothing about the little girl and let her go unasked. He nodded his head and went on his way.","Wu Xiaoya wanted to know what he meant by the Heavenly Hall point and the Ring Point, how to do acupuncture and disacupuncture, but then he thought about it, as a chief of the Green Wood Hall and a disciple of the Grand Master, he wouldn’t even be able to do acupuncture or disacupuncture himself, which would make his subordinates look down upon him. Anyway, dealing with a little girl was not such a difficult matter, so he nodded and said, “I’ve got it.”","Trinket was about to ask him what those acupoints were, but then thought better of it. As Helmsman's apprentice and the Helmsman's pupil's helmsman, he had to some extent to know these things, but the question seemed a bit silly, and anyway he wasn't expecting it to be asked. It didn't seem like much effort to deal with a小姑娘像。 He gave a little nod.","Vice Chief Weixiaobao was about to ask what a 'shen tangxue' or 'huangjiao xue' (Chinese acupuncture points) were, and how one could locate them and unblock them, but then he reconsidered. As the Vice Chief of the Green Wood Hall, and a disciple of the Master of the Main Hall, not knowing how to locate or unblock these points would surely make his subordinates look down on him. He reasoned that dealing with a young girl wouldn't be much of a challenge anyway, so he nodded and said, ""I understand.""","It occurred to Trinket to ask what a 'doubling point' was, and how one went about stimulating it or unlocking it; but then he remembered that he was the leader of the Green Wood Lodge and had even been taken on as the Helmsman's apprentice. He thought that the members of his Lodge would probably think him very silly if they knew that he didn't know the answer to such a question. In any case, he told himself, it shouldn't be very difficult to subdue a girl—even if she did have a doubling point! So he nodded and said: 'Yes, I understand.'","Trinket was about to ask him what the Holy Hall and the Ring-a-Circle points were and how you went about closing them when he reflected that as the Master of the Wooden Lodges and a junior colleague of the Helmsman he would be stuck to the mannerisms of a eunuch; besides which he didn't in any case know the answers to these questions and didn't want to make a fool of himself in front of the other boys. It seemed more sensible to change the subject. 'Yes, Goong-goong,' he said, 'I know.'"

父亲，一九五七年，你躲在我家里间屋里那个地洞里时，你每日每夜，在永恒的黑暗中，追忆流水年月，你至少三百六十次想到了我们家那几十间房屋的屋盖在大火中塌落的情景。 你想到你的父亲我的爷爷在那时刻想到了什么，我的幻想紧追着你的幻想，你的幻想紧追着爷爷的思维。,"Father, when you were hiding in the burrow we dug for you in the floor of my home back in 1957, you recalled those days of your past in the unrelenting darkness. On no fewer than 365 occasions, in your mind you saw the roof of your house crash down amid the flames, and wondered what was going through the mind of your father, my granddad. So my fantasies were chasing yours while yours were chasing Granddad's.","Father, you hid yourself under my bedroom that night when I was buried in a cave between the walls of our house. You dreamed of all those years spent in the dark, recalling scenes from the past, such as the collapse of the houses after the fire. Your imagination followed your imagination closely; your father’s mind followed his own.","FITTs, in 1957, when you hid yourself inside my house, every day year after year, you illuminated the darkness around you by reciting the passing years. Three hundred and sixty times, you focused on the scene when our dozen or so houses fell into flames because of the great fire of that year. Three hundred and sixty times, you followed my imagination, and my imagination followed my father's imagination.","Father, when you hid in the cellar of my house in July of nineteen fifty-seven, you, every night and day, were lost in the eternal darkness, thinking back on the years that had passed and the hundreds of times you thought about what our house's roof looked like as it collapsed in the fire. Your thoughts followed your father, who was my grandfather, and then his thoughts followed mine.","FATHER, ONE YEAR BEFORE HIS DEATH, had buried himself in the underground cave of my home when, every night and day, he poured his thoughts back and forth across the abyss that was eternal darkness. He recalled, on one hand, the hundreds of times he had remembered sitting with my mother as they watched our house's roof collapse in the raging fire; and, on the other hand, he could not help but think about what your father, your granddad, must have been thinking during that desperate moment. Your mind raced frantically between your reality and your grandfather's.","Father, in 1957 when you hid in the secret room of my house, every night in the eternal darkness, you recalled the passing years at least 360 times. You pondered on what happened when the roof of our family's dozens of houses collapsed in flames. You wondered what your father, my grandfather, was thinking in that moment. My imagination followed your imagination, and your imagination pursued his thoughts.","In 1957, when you hid in the small room under the ground, did you spend every night recalling how the fires consumed our hundreds of interconnected rooms? As you thought about your father, my granddad, who thought about our family home burning to the ground, your imagination followed mine, and my imagination followed yours.","In the tunnel beneath the bedroom in our home, in the year 1957, you often thought back over the course of your life, and at least thirty-six times you saw the countless buildings of our estate collapsing in flames. You thought about what your father and mine were thinking during those moments; your thoughts chased after theirs, which in turn chased after your own."

下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","The time for injections during the afternoon was from 3:00 p.m.to 4:00 p.m., which is a half hour of rest. The two of them were alone, sitting side by side. In summer, when the afternoon’s nap had not completely worn off, she couldn’t help but groan as she lay there. She was exhausted, and her mind wouldn’t stop talking even after she fell asleep. She tried to think about what she should say, but it wasn’t clear what she was saying.","In the afternoon they brought their shots in early, leaving empty capsules between them. It was nearly dinner time and they began to fall asleep, but not before a series of napping bouts that made no sense brought them out again. They force themselves to keep their minds on something, but neither can understand what is being said, just as the silvery insects of willow tree Maplegar glow with a loud buzzing. At one moment it was called 'woooah', the next 'woooah'.","It was around three or four o'clock in the afternoon that they came for their shots, and for this hour there was nothing to do but sit face-to-face with them. The two of them were still exhausted after a nap during midday; they could not help yawning again and again. They managed to keep themselves awake and say something, although they did not know what it was. The cicadas on the trees outside kept calling one after another, making a buzzing sound. It was unclear whether it was the real thing or just made up sounds.","It was empty in the clinic by three o'clock, except for Mrs. Wang and her patient. They sat face to face, each falling into a daze after a morning of working in the heat, the mosquitoes biting, but trying hard to keep their spirits up as they yawned endlessly and sneezed. The crickets continued to chirp loudly in the梧桐树上的树枝中,时断时续的响声让这里变得不那么清楚。","Injections administered in the afternoon were usually around three or four o'clock, during this hour which was always empty, just the two of them sitting face-to-face. The afternoons in summer were still suffused with the drowsiness of midday naps, making them yawn repeatedly. They made a feeble attempt to stay awake, but they couldn't even remember what they were saying. The cicadas on the mulberry tree outside their window were incessantly chirping, the sound coming in as a buzzing that was equally unclear.","The needle punctures usually fell between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. This hour seemed to be empty in the clinic, with only the nurse and the patient facing each other. The drowsiness of the summer afternoon had not completely passed, and they could barely keep their heads up. They spoke little, and their conversation was inaudible to one another, like the muffled buzz of the cicadas outside the window.","It was usually empty around three o'clock in the afternoon, and the thorns of summer afternoon drowsiness had not yet gone completely. They fought to stay awake but could not help dozing off. They talked nonsense, and the buzzing cicadas on the loomworm tree outside the clinic added to the confusion."

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","We had no choice but to guess at what he meant when we heard it. Because his father-in-law had always tried hard to buy land for him as a son, and now that his old age is evident, he could not help but feel a little curious about its purpose. Also, he wanted to show off his own dignity. He laughed and said: ""Old Old, you can relax.","By this time on her way there all expectations for the contents of the letter had vanished. Zhou Rui's husband, in spite of the force of his son's dog-eat-dog world, had given such an impression in the previous day with his dealings with the landowners that Two Gou had given up hope of catching him by surprise and preferred, in order to show his own sagacity, to leave a few questions unexplained.","Wu Rui’s wife heard this and guessed at what was coming. It was because her husband had acquired the land by buying it back from his father-in-law several years ago, that he had received help from a dog who had once been his father-in-law’s helper. Seeing Liu Lao-Lao like this, he couldn’t resist his desire; secondly, he wanted to show off his face. He said, ""Old old, you can rest assured.""","By the time Zhou Rui's wife had finished listening, she had fairly guessed the purpose of their visit. But it was a pity that her husband should have waited until now to tell him how much money they had finally spent on the farm. It was a just补偿， for his father had done so much to win over Grannie Liu's hostelmasters by buying land for them. Moreover, he thought it only fair that they should show off their largesse before him. So with a smile on her face, she went on: 'Trusty Grannie, don't you worry!","Zhou Rui's family, having heard this, had already guessed the purpose of their visit. It was due to her husband's past acquisition of land, where he received much help from Dog Er's father, that she found it hard to refuse their request now. Additionally, she also wanted to display her own status. With a smile, she said, ""Old lady, please rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife guessed pretty well what had brought Ruo-er's grandmother. Her husband had, some years ago, profited considerably from Gou-er's father's land dealings; and now, since the old lady was so poor, she did not feel it would be wrong to help her, while at the same time showing off a little to her employer. 'Please don't worry,' she said smiling.","Zhou Rui's wife had by this time got a pretty good idea of what was in the air, though by a quite recent experience. Her own family had been instrumental in persuading her husband to buy a piece of land which he would otherwise not have acquired, and she felt that it would be a slight to her if Grannie Liu should be made a fool of. She determined, therefore, to find some way of saving face for both of them. 'Don't worry, Grannie,' she said. '"

It's fitting that this should happen, so it was followed by a series of steps: cutting off two, then cutting off five, then cutting off four, all at once, and setting fire to the street like a hot mountain. At that time, even though there were civilians who came to help, the fire had already reached its peak, how could they save it down? They burned for one night before it died down. Could they have burnt more than half a dozen homes?","This area of town, therefore, had built itself up under the duress of the Balcones and the Bamboo Scales, with which this city of merchants and brothels had agreed to build its buildings, having suffered a series of arson attempts starting spontaneously from the hoarded fire-wood supplied by the soldiers and civilians on their way from the streets. At first the military leaders believed that the townspeople would be able to burn their houses themselves, but after another few hours the大火已经施于人间的性质, and no one could devise a way through it to extinguish it; hence the night was spent in waiting for the night army to come and rescue them. Not until morning did anyone find out how many houses had been burned.","This family had furniture made of bamboo and wood, and it was meant that this should be the way things would go, so they continued to burn houses like a burning mountain; even then, when there were soldiers and civilians coming to save them, how could they put out the fire?

只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。,"Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.","Only the father, brothers, and uncles of a man, being the teachings of the sages, they must not violate them; therefore, even among brothers, they should not go so far as to include themselves, but rather be limited to the extent that is necessary for the sake of their sons.","Because of the way the圣人留下的法则不允许, 我虽是孙子，却也不得不保守族规，只论守就是了, 并不像慈父那样有所期望，要求自己的儿子也必须得成为如慈父一般的人才而已。","Only the father, uncles and brothers are men who have received instructions from the Sage. Therefore, between brothers, it is enough just to do what they should; I am not a man who needs to be an example for my brothers as their elder.","It was on the model of Confucius that this kind of thing was performed: although, as long as they did not directly contradict what he said, they could give somewhat fuller particulars and even deviate a little from the ideal of a gentleman which it embodies. They never regarded themselves as male figures to be imitated by younger ones.","Only, with regard to father, uncle, brother relationships, these are precepts left by sages, so I dare not defy them. Thus, among brothers, we merely fulfill the general duties and obligations, without any intention of setting a model for others, simply because I am a man.","This was because, while on the subject of fatherhood, brotherhood, and the like, Confucius had left no definite rules to be followed, the young men could not afford to ignore his teachings entirely and had to perform some of their duties. But, contenting themselves with a bare minimum of observance, they had never thought it necessary to make being a man and setting a good example to younger ones an important part of their lives.","But Father and Uncle Wei and the boys: now there one is not free to ignore the precepts of the sage and must be content with making a rough and ready job of it. He did not stop to think that as a man he had a wider responsibility, and that as the elder brother it was in a measure incumbent on him to set an example to the younger."

Her assigned task in Wang Qiyao's life was considerably less serious than Yang He and Zongxi. She wasn't there to take the load but, at the same time, not to take it. She was a form. That was what gave her a place to share with Wang Qiyao.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen could take it. Her mission was not as heavy as Wang Qi'he's, and she had a bit of eating old age, a bit of not caring, which meant that she carried a light burden for Hwang Qi'he.","Wu Peizhen was one of those strong women who could bear any blow life might throw at her. She had not been hit yet, but she lived on borrowed time, like Wang Qiyao; and she appreciated Wang Qiyao's sacrifice.","Fortunately for Wu Peizhen, she could afford it; her life's mission wasn't as heavy as Wang Qiaoyao's. She was content to rely on her past achievements and didn't mind too much about fairness. Being relatively unburdened, she was helping to alleviate the burden on Wang Qiaoyao.","Wu Peizhen was much less constrained by responsibilities than Wang Qiyao, and in many ways she could be said to have lighter burdens—she even took some shortcuts and did not always count her losses, which helped her lead a simpler life and was effectively helping to relieve Wang Qiyao's stress.","Fortunately, it was Wu Peizhen who was made of stern stuff. Though her task in life was a heavier one, she was the one who always put on weight when Wang Qiyao lost hers. She didn't mind sacrificing a bit of her own comfort in order to help Wang Qiyao, who she felt needed her more."

平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。,"There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.","The night of Peace Village is also full of desires, but it does not have the large flower curtains on Wang Qian'er’s curtains. That just makes it look like she has no desire at all. Many desires are hidden deep inside, they are like a thick layer that can’t be squeezed out.","In fact, late at night in Peace Lane there is not a single intriguing prospect in sight, except for Wang Qiyao's windowless room, whose flowers on her door have dried up. Many of them sink deep into one's soul and are eliminated by the sanding machine, where they evaporate like steam.","There is also much to think about in Peaceful Street at night, but it cannot be seen because there is no big flower on the curtains of Wang Qiyue's house. Many thoughts are buried deep in one's heart, like silt. They are all forced by life to survive and grind down until they become a solid block. How could anything so turbulent come up?","Underneath the tranquil surface of Peace Lane, however, one has as many thoughts as Wang Qiyao's, which simply cannot be brought to the fore because of the thick layer of sediment that has accumulated. Such thoughts sink to the bottom of her heart, to be brewed into something strong through the exertions of real-life chores and demands.","The nights in a peaceful lane indeed had many possibilities, just not as vivid as the large flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains. Many of these possibilities were submerged deep within, like sediment. They were all shaped by the hardships of living, squeezed dry, drained of moisture, and hardened into chunks; no matter how tumultuous the circumstances, they could not rise to the surface.","Underneath the quietude of those Shanghai nights was a abundance of longing, though not necessarily the kind that surfaced in the way that the giant flowers on Wang Qiyao's curtains did—all kinds of thoughts lay hidden, like sediment, too exhausted to rise to the top; no matter how hard they were squeezed or how much water was drained from them, they never made it to the surface—and yet, given the right circumstances, they could rise up once again.","Even Peace Lane had its share of secrets, but they remained buried deep inside, like sediment at the bottom of a jar. It was a hard-knock life, from which all the moisture had been wrung out; nothing stirred, and the contents had solidified into large clumps."
这种弄堂的房屋看上去是鳞次栉比，挤挤挨挨，灯光是如豆的一点一点，虽然微弱，却是稠密，一锅粥似的。,"Apartment structures are built virtually on top of one another, cheek by jowl, breathing down upon each other's necks. Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.","These shophouses look like they're clustered together, crowded together, with lights so faint that they're barely visible; yet they're dense, as if a soup was boiling.","The longtang buildings appear to be packed tightly onto each other, with dots of light seeming to slithereardrops of paint on tiny grains of light. Like bowls and crocks holding as many beans, the lighting is sparse even though it is abundant.","The houses of this narrow lane look like they're a jumble, crammed together and lit up by flickering lights that are barely visible, yet dense enough to seem like a pot of soup.","On the surface, these longtang appear to be a mess, with buildings of different sizes and shapes crammed together, their dim lights giving off a vague glow.","The houses in these alleys are neatly packed one after another, crammed closely together. The lights are tiny dots, feeble yet dense, like a pot of porridge.","These longtang look like scale models lined up shoulder to shoulder with close-packed buildings glowing dimly, as if a pot of porridge left on the stove has begun to bubble.","The buildings look cramped and squeezed together from the outside, but once inside they light up the area with a density of flickering lamplight as numerous as grains of rice."
薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。,"'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.","Peng Ben said that he would not have dared to disturb him if it were not for his birthday: because on the 3rd of January, it was my birthday, but I did not know where they had come from. It was quite coarse, long, and so soft; it was a large fresh pumpkin; it was so big that it resembled a giant fish.","I'm afraid I couldn't manage it on my own,' said Bao-yu, 'because by the time the month's end there must have been already gone over half a dozen or more corsages and several hundred flowers for him to choose from. They would have cost quite a lot of money, and besides he doesn't seem to have got these from anyone ordinary; he must have gotten them from some experienced people.","Wang Xiaopan said, ""I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been ordered to."" He had only dared to do so because the day before last was his birthday, and he happened to meet some people who were not very familiar with him: a big, long, fragrant lotus root; a large watermelon; a pig and fish that were sent by the Siamese court as a gift of respect.","I wouldn't have asked for help if I didn't need to, but it's my birthday on the threerd of the following month and so when I found a fucking thick one down at Uncle Hu's place and a really fucking nice, really fucking long one at Great-Granddad's, I was a bit worried they'd all been brought in by some old chum of theirs who goes hopping all over the place like,' said Trinket. 'And what did I find when I cut open the fucking thing? A fucking big, fucking nice, fucking Hmong pork buns and a fucking big fucking Siam elephant-scented pineapple!","Xue Pan said, ""If it weren't for this, I wouldn't have disturbed you: it's because on the third day of the first lunar month, it was my birthday. Who could have known that Hu Old Man and Cheng Old Man found such things? Such thick, long, tender, fresh lotus roots; such large watermelons; such long, such large Siamese imperial tribute spiritcedar-scented Siamese pigs and fish.""","I know,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you about it either, only it's my birthday next Monday and some of the old fellows, Mr Hu and Mr Cheng, have been round asking for some. I don't know where they got this stuff from, but they brought a thick, long, crisp piece of lotus root; a big watermelon; a long, large pig and a fish that must have cost them a fortune because they came all the way from India to put it in the Emperor's palace.","'I wouldn't have dared, otherwise. But it's my birthday, the third of the first month, and I hadn't expected Hu and Cheng to get hold of any of this stuff — alix root and sorghum wine and sharp-crunchy fresh lotus-root and long, big, fragrant Borneo pork and fish from Siam."

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her part, she had complained a lot about Mr. Chen’s bed, but Mr. Chen also left behind countless wishes for her, all of which were not fulfilled by the state-owned enterprise and the real estate industry. The end result was that she could no longer secure one private house as God’s favor or heaven’s grace.","For her part, she had made a big mess while taking over the business; Mr. Yan,枕上百般愿意，眠中万般眷恋，终于只成一句:「恩恩，当地政府分给我们的这笔巨款，我已向天报到了，恳请皇上立即发赈，将这处我们各自所有但共建不造的私人花园弄平，新建一栋为国尽忠、为士子耕种的豪华大宅！」","For this, she had been complaining incessantly, and Mr. Yan had pledged his thousand words and ten thousand vows on the pillow that all private property would be taken over by the state, and that even if he could save a private house, it was as if heaven and earth were gifting him with such a privilege. The garden villa turned out to be nothing but a dream.","Madame was furious. And Mr. Yan made a thousand promises and oaths that he would never allow their home to be nationalized, but then state-run enterprise became reality and the answer was no to her request for a apartment in the backyard.","For this, she had plenty of complaints, and Mr. Yan made all kinds of vows and oaths while lying on his pillow. But when the public-private enterprises were merged, and the properties were taken over by the state, it was considered a divine blessing just to keep one private house. The dream of living in a garden villa finally turned out to be a bubble.","No wonder she complained so much: Mr. Yan had promised her everything under the sun — and then came nationalization, and all their business property was taken away. They were lucky to have one small house left. The beautiful garden apartment they had built was just a bubble that eventually burst.","For this she had cause to gripe, and thousands of vows she made to her husband, each one more extravagant than the last, each one a pledge of undying love. But it was a marriage of convenience, a business alliance, and in the end the state claimed everything, leaving her a tiny fraction of a house to call her own, a garden and a Western-style house that turned out to be an illusion."

韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。,The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.,"With a wave of his arms, Wang Xiaobang came forward with a burst of energy, and he could bear the pain that was on his body as well. To ask Lu Xianxiao this question, all of his body's muscles were in pain. He couldn't help but laugh when he heard her reply.","Trinket came running over, injured arm still at his side. He could bear the pain; but when he asked Blossom how she was, he only found himself smiling uneasily because of the agony in his body.","Wu Xiaohong came walking towards him, his pain could bear. To the question of Rui Chu, he felt that every part of his body was in agony and couldn’t help but let out a cry.","Trinket hurried over the as much as he could. He had the strength, he thought, to withstand the pain if he did, but when Blossom asked him what it was, all over his body seemed to go churning, and he cried out in agony.","Vigorous and unyielding, Wei Xiaobao strode forward. Although the pain in his body was tolerable, upon hearing Rui Chu's question, every inch of his bones and muscles ached. He could not help but make a low sound of discomfort.","Trinket had withstood the journey tolerably well, considering how painful he was feeling, but a single question from Blossom seemed to paralyse his nerves everywhere at once and he couldn't help crying out.","Trinket summoned up enough strength to answer her question, and in doing so the pain of his wounds drove all else from his mind. He gasped and winced, for his whole body seemed to ache from top to toe."
看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I had a bit of joy at first glance but also some unease. For these women stood so far away, they could not hear what was said there, and there was a woman wearing a sleeping robe who lay on several different positions. She was lying sideways, bent over, and then she was leaning against the wall. Another one lay facing the wall with her legs stretched out flat, while the other half of her body was hanging off the ground. The half-hidden sleepwear was covering her body. The bed was wrinkled as well. It was a little too much for me to stand in front of.","The sight of them standing outside the curtain made its way inside her heart a little, even though all she could see was the direction in which they were lying. They were a couplee, on their side, with a bed already set up; another was on her back, stretched out on her hands and knees; and a third, one of the women guessed, had somehow rearranged herself so that her body was tilted towards the headboard and that she was lying on her back with her legs over the edge of the room—a single sheet covering nothing but her shoulders. The last picture showed her body completely outside of the sheet, showing clearly how it was beginning to show age.","There was a little happiness and a little boredom in my heart as I read this, for they were standing too far away to hear what was being said there, so all I could see was one woman lying on her bed, laying in various positions, first with her back turned, then with her face up, and the other time only half of her body was laid down while the other half was hanging down to the ground. Her transparent nightgown covered most of her body, and the bed was already wrinkled.","Wang Qiyao's heart averted joy was mixed with distaste. She kept at arm's length so as not to miss anything, but she couldn't help noticing how awkward they looked standing there. The one woman, wearing a transparent nightie, lay on her side; the other, on her back; and another, only the top half of her body was exposed, her legs dangling off the side of the bed. The thin, translucent nightie added nothing to her elegance; the bed was pitted with wrinkles, and the scene was a little disgusting.","I felt a mix of delight and a hint of disgust upon seeing it. Since they were positioned far away, they couldn't hear what was being discussed, but they could see a woman in a nightgown lying on a bed, changing positions. One moment she was on her side, another she was facing upwards, and in yet another instance, only half her body was on the bed while the other half dangled off the floor. The translucent nightgown clung to her figure, and the bed had begun to show signs of wear, which also added to the feeling of disgust.","This made her a bit happy, but it also made her a bit bored. Since they were standing far away, they could not make out what was being said, but they could see a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed in different positions—one side, then back, then half up, half down. The see-through nightgown covered her body, which was beginning to wrinkle, adding to Wang Qiyao's sense of weariness.","He felt a curious mixture of pleasure and boredom: pleasure that they were there, but bored with the sight of the woman lying on the bed, her translucent gown draped around her body, the bedspread wrinkled, her head resting in several different positions, one with her face towards the wall, another with her face up, and another with her body twisted sideways, her legs stretched out on the floor."

Well, I think I've had enough of that sort of attitude!","If you yourself do not respect others, you're just sliding down a slippery slope with ill intentions, yet you blame others for being biased when it's your own fault.",But instead of improving themselves they have to go mixing with the wrong sort of people and getting themselves into all sorts of trouble.
