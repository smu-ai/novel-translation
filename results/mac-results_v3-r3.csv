虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother was with him on the field of roses in high粱地， which was a solemn period that he had been there for a long time， I also carried out my crime and virtue. However， it was indeed a father who lived in the region of high mountain East China， whose name is one of the most beautiful families in the area. But she was married to his mother by marriage as a single man in her own family， so they were both from the same spring and autumn， and they had quite a degree of randomness and instability. Besides， I don't have any roots at all， so I call him ""Rema"" more accurately when writing about what happened then.","Even though she was a凤凰在地的高级庄户新娘， she already had the weight of my crime balance—though she was also the son's marriage wife who bore his child, Gou Zhen Guo, and since her father hadn't come from a rich noble family, it was still more the result of缘分和天命。 So when writing about their relationships, Yu Zhan'ao was still referred to more correctly as Zong Qun's bridegroom. He hadn't even been born yet.","While my grandmother was with him in the cornfield, they were getting along harmoniously. In that solemn process of love and pain, although my grandmother was also carrying half of my sins and half of my virtues, she was still a clear-cut wife from the Nantong region. But then, my grandmother was a single woman who got married by the side of her family, and her husband had been randomly married without any rules. Besides, my father wasn't even down on his knees, so I still call him Yu Quaoleo when writing about those things.","Even though Grandma and he had flown into the凰的痛苦和幸福的庄严殿堂, she became a half-sick half-happy childbearing gourd field, but since Grandma was the daughter of a wealthy family from Northeast Gaomi, she retained the nature of a permanent windbreaker father, and爷爷与她总是如胶似漆的感情上的随意和不稳定的婚姻,偶然结合在一起。因此,到了后来,当我写关于他们事情的时候,还是以独子的身份称他为 Yu Zhan'ao is more accurate.","Although my grandmother was on the edge of high粱地里凤凰和谐， during that solemn ceremony where she was both suffering from sorrow and happiness, I remember that when my grandfather was still a bachelor, he had been a father who was also a married woman, and it was always a mixture of randomness, unpredictability, and instability between her and me. Moreover, I did not descend from the earth, so I called him ""Mr. Lu"".","Although she was already a凤凰在蓝天中生长, and had survived the single-handed trauma of balancing his crimes and gains, Mother, having inherited her father's reputation as a fair-minded man, was now a widow with a mistress, and therefore still too young to have married. Father, who had never set foot on land, didn't even live on our mother's land, making it hard to find the right fit between their personalities. So the things that really interested me most about this chapter were things like how Old Colour bought a bride from a sorghum field, while he'd also murdered his wife and the daughter of his cousin Jia Huan—and we hadn't even mentioned the fact that he'd been convicted of both Murder of the Brother and Marriage to a Little Maid and Murder by诱骗。","Although I called him my grandfather-in-law because he had been married to my grandmother in the cornfield, I felt that it was more appropriate to call him Xiao Gao, since my grandmother had borne me a son with mixed guilt and shame. She was indeed the father of a family from the northern part of Shandong Province. He had been married by custom, but not by law, as he was not yet settled down. So when I wrote about what happened then, I still preferred to call him Xiao Gao.","Although Grandma had consummated her love for Old Geng in the sorghum field, she had not been pregnant as a consequence of their sin; furthermore, because Grandma had been single housewife of Shan family, she had always acted freely and unilaterally, even when it involved harm to herself or others. But by the time this section of the novel took place, she was no longer Shan Guo Northeast Editor, and Old Geng had left the area. So, calling him Yu Zhan'ao instead of Old Geng was more accurate."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was very pleased and said, ""Well, you have a pile of dung on your right cheek; no one is willing to pay for it. Why not just carve up a pig? It will be good business.""","I'm very pleased then, he said, because there's no one here who'd like to buy a cow, but if I drew on a lot of grass, I think I'd make a good lot of money.'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Well, I'll put a pile of dung on my left cheek, but no one will pay for it. Why not put a pig there? It's fat and stupid – it should do well.""","Good!' he said, twirling the dagger in his fingers. 'I'll carve a cow, then. Easy money, a perfect market for me!'","He was delighted and said, ""Ah, just add some dung to your face, but no one will buy it; instead, you could put a pig on there, which is good for business.""","I'm a little pleased, sir, with my idea. Let's draw a big bunch of cow dung on the right face of my face and nobody will ever be able to sell it. That'll give me a good profit!'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Hmm, right side - a pile of cow dung - nobody will pay for it, so let's engrave a pig instead. It is fat and stupid - it will certainly be popular.""","This is easy,' said Old Colour gratulatedively. 'A cow-pat! No one's going to buy the cow-pat, obviously. Why don't you carve a Pig? Easy Pigs. They'll want to buy them.'"

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","Along each side of the road, a series of thick, blocky stalks of wheat stand stiffly, unbroken by the wind. They were all crowded together and looked at each other from across the street, gray-green wheat stalks sleeping peacefully. There was no difference between them; the grain on one stalk would never be recognized as that of the other. This grain was endless, flowing like a river.","The sorghum on either side of the road was firmly joined together, like a rows of terraces where each side was bound by an impenetrable wall. One could not tell the difference between two crops, because every bush was锁定得紧紧，如同蜿蜒的河溪，没有尽头。","On either side of the road, the sturdy high grain blocks up close together like a wall, all crowded together, looking at each other, greenish-gray grains of corn sleeping without opening their eyes, one with another grain cannot be distinguished from the other, corn never ends, as if it were a flowing river.","The roads were covered with red square tiles, solid and rigid, packed so tightly together that they didn't even look like one another from this vantage point. The green stalks, still closed-eyed, seemed incapable of distinguishing themselves from the others; the tiling stretched out forever in front of them, flowing like a flowing river.","The fields on both sides of the road form a complex network, forming a continuous structure. Each grain is held together by pressure, so that they cannot distinguish each other. The green wheat stalks sleep in bed with each other, unable to recognize each other. There is no end to this cycle of growth; the river flows slowly. This seems like a flowing stream of grains.","The sorghum on either side of the road was firmly binded together, impenetrable; shaved-face shaped like each stalk, the tightly packed stalks could not tell one from another, sleeping faces of the sorghum; the river of sorghum flowed endlessly unapproachable.","On either side of the road, rows of corn were piled up like massive blocks. They were all closely packed together, each one looking at the other, their green leaves sleeping, as if they could not distinguish one from another. The corn was endless, as if it flowed endlessly.","The roads were lined with firm sorghum plants that held themselves in check in a stubborn pack, their leaves green as marbles. The new leaves never took off, for the surrounding stalks had grown too tall to see. The river of plants seemed to flow steadily past."

It was a knock of a woman who was upstairs, and it sounded like a loud noise, as if someone had just heard that the lady's mother was getting old and sick. The lady's mother had lost money for this evening and had been angry with her. She was going to make the little girl's life difficult by putting them off until they have a new suit of clothes.","Jia Rui, attention spent on a matter which needed attention, heard a commotion at the back of the house and recognized the sound as his mother's voice crying 'Nannie!'

He had come round to补偿她的侮辱, to hang up a few or a ten or a hundred pounds more against one of the little countesses.","Chic Fanny was calculating the money loss at the front of the house when she heard a commotion from behind.

这件事有两种可能的原因，一是他下来视察，遇见了我对他装聋作哑，因而大怒，不走了。 二是他不是下来视察，而是听说陈清扬和我有了一腿，特地来找我的麻烦。,"His visit could be accounted for in two ways: one was that he came down to our team for the investigation, but when he met someone like me who played dumb with him, he got pissed off and decided to stay; the other was that he came down to our team not for investigation, but to pick on me, after hearing that Chen Qingyang and I had a love affair.","Two possible reasons for this event are two: one is that he came down to see me and express his disapproval of my silence; another is that he did not come down to see me, but rather heard about our affair with Chen Qingyan and went out to trouble me.","There are two possible explanations for this: one is that he came down to see him and told him not to talk but then changed his mind and prevented her from going.

The other is that he did not come down but heard about my affair with Chen Qingyun and went after me because he was surprised at the news that we had a relationship.",There could be two possible reasons for this: one is that he went down to see him and met my confessions; or (more likely) it was not me but someone else—it was not I who invited him over but someone else—the reporter.

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes. 'You're just like I imagined. Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.'","He has changed his appearance on media, wearing a suit and appearing to be a gentleman, ""You and I look alike, both elites; this is for the elite class. Its contents and意境，普通人很难理解；to play with its knowledge level, it's high in complexity and depth of content.""","Instead, he adopted a refined air of sophistication that suggested he had been abandoned somewhere abroad, in journalism or broadcasting. He was dressed in stylish clothes: suitcases lined with丝光油纸， shoes polished of their dust, even his shirt seemed clean. While most artists would prefer to be forgotten, Three Body has succeeded in creating a cult following and cultivated the deepest depths of its themes and contents. 'To play this game, you need to have more than just a good sense for mathematics,' he said. 'You'll need to know far enough about mathematics to understand Trisolaris; you'll need to know far deeper and更宏大。'","He had changed his usual dirty-looking homeless man image on TV screens for a suit-wearing gentleman with class and elegance. ""We are pretty much what you imagine, all of us are high society people, The Three Body is prepared for your kind."" It's hard for the common person to understand its contents and meanings; its level of knowledge required to play it is too high for most people to attain.","He had changed out of the dirty,degraded costume he wore on the media channels. The suit and leather shoes he wore gave him airiness and style. 'You are closer than I thought to an elite audience,' he said, continuing his lecture. 'That's why Three Body was prepared for you elite people. What substance lies behind this game, and what imagery, neither the ordinary person nor the gaming community is capable of understanding. '","He changed his image on the media from a dirty, unkempt man to a polished gentleman, wearing suits and appearing to be handsome. ""You and I are just like that. We are elites. The Three-Body Prose is prepared for this class of people, its meaning and essence are incomprehensible to mortals; what you need to learn, its level of depth and scope are beyond the comprehension of mortals.""","The man changed from the gaudy, lost-aimed wretched that he had been made into a film star to a sophisticated gentleman on closer examination. 'Not me, exactly,' he said; but his clothes were clean and immaculate. 'You, well, you can call yourself one of the elite. Three Body is developed to the very highest levels of sophistication. Its content and themes go far beyond what a common person cannot overlook. You need to know the details of our world, but at a certain level you require far more than that....'","He had changed from his usual dirty-looking homeless man on the media, now dressed up in a suit and looked like a gentleman. ""We're similar to you guys, we are all elites. 'Three Body' is for your class, its essence and意境是常人无法理解的。你需要的知识层次之高、内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”","He changed out of the dirty, scruffy clothes he wore on TV and into a suit and tie. He was a dapper man, if a bit old-fashioned, and his message seemed to have been designed for people like him. The book was obviously meant for the kind of elite audience to which he had referred. Its meaning, he explained, was beyond common understanding; and the level of knowledge required to understand it is also above what average people possess.'"

像她们这样半路上的朋友，各有各的隐衷，别看严家师母竹筒倒豆子，内中也有自己未必知道的保留，彼此并不知根知底，能有一些同情便可以了。,"People like them, who become friends at mid-life, tend to keep part of themselves hidden away. Even Madame Yan, who usually wore her heart on her sleeve, retained certain secrets that she herself might not have understood. It was not necessary for them to know everything there was to know about each other—a little sympathy went a long way.","Like this kind of half-way friends, each with his own hidden inclinations, one can see that Mrs. Li’s secret is not confined to herself, but also there must be some knowledge among us that we do not know exactly. We can have a little sympathy for them.","People like the Cheviots who came and visited seemed to keep their secrets all along, but behind their closed doors they had hidden things that ordinary people seldom knew about. Friends like you don't really need to be on top of everything—to be somewhat understanding of them can at least be considered compassionful.","Such a half-way friend, each with her own secrets, don’t look at Madame Zhai’s pouring out her chest as if she were telling everyone something she did not know, but each of them had their own ground rules and it was difficult for others to know about. If they could feel some sympathy, that would be enough.","As we often say, life is like a theater: people come and go. Although Madame Yan told them all about her secrets as though they were her potpourri, one could tell that some of them remained somewhat uncomfortable; Wang Qiyao, it seems, had something to keep private. Despite her boasting about having no secrets, she was surprised to find that her friends, who seemed to know everything about her, showed genuine understanding and compassion.","Like friends who meet on the way, each with his own hidden inclinations, it's not surprising that the Ye family mother and father have something to hide; they don't know what is inside their minds and can't tell them where or when.","People like Wang Qiyao and her friends who came and visited could hardly be described as easy to relate to; on the contrary, they went far out in some cases—and even their not-so-subtle intimates had no means of knowing what was going on behind the scenes that would enable them to call them on them. To show some civility, one should perhaps be a little more reserved about their innermost feelings.","Like friends who met halfway, each with their own secrets, look at how Lady Zhen poured out her beans from a bamboo barrel – there may be some secrets she doesn’t know herself, but they don’t have much connection, so let’s just show some compassion for now.","A true friend is one who tells you nothing but a lie; Madame Yan may have been forthright about keeping secrets, but she didn't realize that she had a heart condition. It's easy for us onlookers to be mistaken for her; after all, we were all fooled by her when we first met."
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'","Qian Xiaobang wanted him to explain what a ""Shengmen Pavilion"" and ""Jihe Pavilion"" are, how to point them out, and what to do with them, but when he thought about it, he was not able to point them out or deal with them. How could this be so bad for his subordinates? Anyway, dealing with a little girl wasn't too hard.点头应道：""I know.""","I get the feeling that these 'God Delights' 'they're-for-the-guardians' there's a god who does this,' Trinket said to himself. 'But I don't see how they can possibly know about circles and Loop-Points and such. Anyway, I've got a little Temple for gods to go to too—though I haven't had any experience of that myself. Anyway, it seems like enough trouble to trouble someone really easy-up.'","Wu Xiaolai wanted to know what he meant by ""God Hall Navel Point"" and ""Ring Point"". He wondered how to press on the navel point and release it. But after thinking for a moment, as he was the head monk of the Green Wood Temple and the disciple of the Grand Master, he couldn't even do these things himself. How could his subordinates look down upon him? In any case, dealing with a little girl wouldn't be too difficult. Wu Xiaolai nodded and said, ""I've got it.""","Trinket was about asking the Helmsman what the God-In-Hand and the Ring-Way were, and how to press them home and how to relieve the effects of pressure, but算了算自己是青木堂的领导人物,又是舵主的徒儿,如果搞不清楚点穴和解穴这些玩意,人家会小看我么,于是管不了那么多了,点了点头:「知道了。」","I have just translated your request from Chinese into English, but I will not include any other words or phrases. Here is my translation:

1. ""What does a heaven's temple point mean? How do you point it, how do you release it?"" But thinking about this, I realize that I am a grandmaster of the Jade Tree Sect, which was my senior disciple's senior master, so I would never be able to perform these things.

2. ""How can I point it out to you?"" I nodded my head, knowing what I had to say already.

3. ""No, I don't think so."" I simply nodded my head as well.","I get what 'the sacred hall' is called,' Trinket said to Trinkhuan as they stood facing the stone pillar which seemed to speak to them; 'But I don't see how 'the drum-closing point' and 'the drum-unrolling point' work. And I don't know how to use it. It seems too much trouble to solve a little girl's problem, do you think so, Brother?'","Wu Xiaogang wanted to ask him what it meant by Shengtang meridian and Huantiao meridian, how to point them out, and how to unblock them. But he thought of his status as a Young Master of the Yellow Wood Hall and the disciple of the Grandmaster, and he didn’t know how to point out or unblock them either. Isn’t that letting subordinates look down upon? After all, dealing with a little girl wasn’t a difficult thing, so he nodded his head and said, “I’ve got it.”","Trinket wanted to ask her what these acupoints were (Godfather's Claw and Ring Jump), how they were to be pointed and how to find out that sort of thing, but he decided it would be more impressive to show off his own limited skills. 'I get it,' he said, deferring to her authority. 'Thanks.'"

话都说得有些不搭调，可也是借酒吐真言，放了平时则是难出口的。,"Her words were inappropriate to the occasion; obviously, alcohol was bringing out some hidden truths.","The conversation is a bit off-kilter, but it's also a way of venting out real feelings, so when you're not there, it's hard for people to speak.","But if we cannot agree on something, you have to say it in a nonconventional way—wine, if you will—and in也不例外。","The talk was off the mark, but it was a truth-telling drink that made him speak out freely, not usually spoken out.","Wang Qiyao was speaking incoherent gibberish, but this was also the release of feelings she had been repressing all these years.","I can't understand what you're saying; it's also a way of expressing truth, but if you let it out now is not easy.","But if you don't do everything you say you will do, it's not fair to a guest.","It's a little awkward, but it's also true that drinking helps me say what I really think.","Wang Qiyao had better wine than clean water; indeed, a drink was sometimes necessary for the truth to emerge."

Only they two were there, sitting face-to-face with each other. They couldn’t sleep during the midday nap of summer, so they kept on yawning.

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","According to Zhou Rie, he had guessed a little. For one thing, his father was able to buy land by force of his own. Now that he saw what Liu Tao did, he felt very uncomfortable; secondly, he wanted to show off his own good looks. He laughed and said: ""I don't mind.","By this she already had a good idea of what the old lady's intentions were. It was because some friend of her grandson had bought land recently, and many of his father's having been earned by force, Trinket had found Mr. Liu struggling to bring about its sale. He had always expected that, after so much talk about this or that, he would now conclude that it was best not to press. But there was something a bit impolitically sly about this old woman's remarks which told them that she really wanted him to say yes. 'Of course not,' replied Zhou Rui's wife, sceptical.","Wang Ru’s wife had guessed it from the beginning because her husband had helped buy their land several years ago. Now seeing Liu Lao’s kindness, she was unable to help herself. She said with a smile: “Don’t worry about it, old man.”","Zhou Rui's wife grasped her purpose as soon as she heard part of the conversation which betrayed it; but a close friendship had bound old Gou-er's father's heart and senses in ways that could not always be immediately understood, and though he was now near the end of his days, there were still in him the glitter of an earlier era. 'Trust us!' she told him.","I had guessed a little of what he meant by his words. Because he was aware that his father had given him so much money for buying land. Now he saw that Tuan was doing well with his money, and he couldn't help but feel sorry for himself; secondly, it would be good for him to show off his own modesty. He laughed and said: ""Old old you're sure to have your way here.","By this reference he had caught the main thought which enabled him to say what he did. His wife, it being so known that his husband had in former times sued hard to get land, had indeed been compelled to pay out all the soil available on a contest-rigorous footing for the benefit of four of his sons, and the old man was now in a trousseau for the commendable fact that their case was not unsuccessful; secondly, it appeared to him that if he remained composed, his mother would no longer feel able to press him: hence he made a little giggle and said 'No worries!","Zhou Ruye understood immediately that there was more than meets the eye. Because his husband had bought a piece of land several years ago with help from Gou'er, he could not refuse the old man’s request now. He also wanted to show off his own good manners. So he said, “Old Old, you can rest easy.”","Zhou Rui's wife guessed at parts of his request; but so involved was she in the desire to outdo Gou-ru's father that all she could say was: 'Old Liu, I promise you a good time."

It's not right.","He wanted to go down to the market, but we had to wait until someone took care of us so that nobody would take advantage of us while we were here himself and couldn't be taken off duty.","He also wants to go to the street, but he can't because we haven't been sent back yet, and it doesn't fit our rules.","He also wanted to go to the market to show off, but neither of us could get hold of Wang Qiyao, so leaving us here with no one to look after us, it was not fair.","He wanted to go to the street too, but he was not allowed to leave us until we returned after they had closed the gates. It did not fit with the rules.","He had wanted to ride the streets too, but it wasn't until we got permission to come back home that someone other than him looked after us and was available to take care of the laundry that they were willing to let us stay.","He also wants to go shopping, but we can’t let him leave until it’s time for us to be released, which is against the rules.","He also wanted to go out on the street, but by the time the security people let us go, it was already night and we couldn't keep us watchfully here without breaking our rules."

此方人家俱用竹篱木壁，也是劫数应当如此，于是接二连三牵五挂四，将一条街烧得如火焰山一般；彼时虽有军民来救，那火已成了势了，如何救得下? 直烧了一夜方息，也不知烧了多少人家。,"And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process.","This home has used bamboo fences, walls of wood and stone, also like this should be so. Therefore, it is a coincidence that they have been attached two by two, hanging four and five from the wall, which has burnt up a street as if it were a fire mountain; while though there was military help coming to save them, their fire had already become strong enough, how could they save it down? The burning lasted all night before it ended. No one knows how many houses they had burned.","Having then discovered the method of constructing houses from bamboo and wooden posts and so on that would work, they built a new city; but very soon after, the military and other public servants came to rescue them and all the properties under their protection burned away in a single night, though though many may have been there before the fire and many may still be there today. No one knows how many were built during the process.","This family used bamboo fences and wooden walls. This was indeed their due, so they proceeded with a string of fires, burning down streets after streets until there was nothing left but ashes. Even when the fire was finally put out, it had taken them all night long. They didn't know how many houses were burned that day.","The residents of this part of the city used bamboo fences and wooden walls for their doors and windows. It was a piece of luck that such a primitive mode of construction should have come into use at this crucial moment; so far, so good! Step by step, trap after trap, they brought down the house on the street behind them and reduced it to a smoky, burning cinder. By the time the firefighters came on the scene, it was too late—the fire had become too big to control and burned through the night, destroying many a house.","This is how the household furnishings were used for bamboo fences and walls, too, which is also a curse that must happen; therefore, when it was connected by two and then connected again by three and four, the streets of the street had become like a fire mountain. At this time, though there were military and civilians coming to help, the flames had already turned into a force. How could they rescue them? They burnt one night and did not know how many houses had been burned.","Now,' said the author, 'we could put up our bamboo walls and our thatch and hope for the best; but just think of all the misery we would create by burning so many houses! We must go ahead and build those many thousands of huts ourselves, though—we shall soon burn through them all. After a night or two's work we should be done with it all up.","This family had used bamboo fences and wooden walls; it was their destiny that they should burn like a fire mountain. At first, some soldiers and civilians came to help but by then the fire was too great for them to put out. They burnt all night long before it finally died down, not knowing how many houses were burned.","The walls of the longtang here were made of rick竹和木板， this was part of what the Alkali Path system was designed to accommodate. As a result, there followed a chain of two, then three, burnt buildings, with the final one being the entire street. The soldiers and the villagers could hardly contain the flames, which burned all night and claimed many lives."
叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上台。 她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。,"Ye's wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd's front row. She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.","The wife of the physicist who is also a physics professor from the same department, Shang Li, stood up from her seat at the front row and walked up to the podium. She was wearing a very off-putting green t-shirt that didn't go well with her red-hatted colleagues, but those familiar with her had thought it odd that she chose to wear a more refined, elegant dress when she taught classes.","Shao Lin, another physics professor, stood up from her seat behind her husband and walked to the stage. She chose to wear a short green dress that was neither fitting nor comfortable, apparently in order to��锵出红卫军的气息。 But someone knew Shao Lin from before: she had always taught with distinction in formal robes, and it occurred to her that, despite her wearing such a modest one, she felt awkward.","Ye Zhaotai’s wife, professor Liang Xuelin from the same department, rose from her seat at the front of the audience and made her way up to the stage. She wore a very un-tailored green suit that seemed to want to be closer to the red-baiting crowd, but those who knew Liang well recalled how she used to wear fine silk dresses when lecturing. They found it rather uncomfortable.","Ye Zhetai's wife, along with another physics professor Shao Lin, rose to the stage from the audience, which had shifted to the rear of the theater and was now filled with only red guards. Ye Zhetai's wife had on a green shirt that seemed too small for her—she wanted to be closer to the Red Guards' uniforms, but someone who knew Sha liked her suggestion that her old habit of wearing elegant traditional clothing when she taught was hard to give up.","The wife of physicist Zhou Chang-tai, who is also her classmate from the same department, stood up at the front row and walked to the podium. She wore a very loose green dress that seemed to be too close to red hooligans, but she felt awkward when she saw familiar Professor Liang.","Shi Lin took a step up from her seat behind her wife and stood on stage. She walked down the screenless stage in a pair of green dress that was neither fitting nor fashionable; familiar with Shao's husband, she wondered why her modest green gown seemed closer to the protesters. Her feelings for the dress puzzled her.","Ye Zhaotai’s wife, Professor Sun Ling from his department, stood up from her seat at the front of the audience and walked forward onto the stage. She was dressed in a very unflattering green blouse that clearly wanted to get closer to the color of the Red Guards, but people who were familiar with Sun Ling found it strange because she used to wear elegant evening gowns when teaching.","Ye Zhetai's wife, Professor Shao Lin, rose to address the crowd from the platform, which was filled with Red Guards dressed in green. Clearly, she wanted to find ways to feel closer to the crowd, but because she knew people who had seen her in her traditional long-pink T恤出席学术报告会, this green uniform felt inappropriate."

“审判日”号宽阔的甲板上很空荡，只是后甲板上有一个人在用水龙头冲洗缆桩，汪淼从高处看得很清楚，当船的这一部分从钢柱间移过的瞬间，那人的身体突然僵硬了，水龙头从他手里滑落；与此同时，连接龙头的胶皮水带也在不远处断成两截，水从那里白花花地喷了出来，那人直直地站了几秒钟就倒下了，他的身体在接触甲板的同时分成两截。,"Judgment Day's wide deck was empty save for one man standing near the stern hosing down the ship's bollards. From his vantage point, Wang saw everything clearly. The moment that that section of the ship passed between the pillars, the hose broke into two pieces not too far from the man, and water spilled out. The man's body stiffened, and the nozzle tumbled from his hand. He remained standing for a few seconds, then fell. As his body contacted the deck, it came apart in two halves.","The ship's broad deck is empty except for a person cleaning the cable on the stern of the ship. Maoming can see clearly from above. When the part of the ship that was about to cross the steel pillar suddenly stiffened as the ship passed over, his body suddenly became rigid when he raised his hand. The water pipe with the rubber hose attached to it fell out of his hand; water sprayed from its mouth at a steady speed. He stood there for a few seconds before falling down. His body split in half through contact with the deck, his body being separated in two parts at the same time.","Judgment Day was empty except for the person washing the pylon with the flow of the ship's water hose as it shifted across the top of the ship. Wang could make out the motion; when the other crewman's body broke through the wall, the hose fell from his hand; immediately after, the two ends of the rubber membrane were broken into pieces, causing gurgling water to spill from one of the cracks.","The broad deck of the ""Judgment Day"" was empty except for one person washing the mooring cleats with a water hose from the high deck. Huang Mao could see clearly as the ship passed by the steel columns on this section of the deck. The man's body suddenly stiffened when he moved through the space between the decks. A water hose connected to his hand dropped off. At the same time, the rubber water hose near him broke into two pieces, spouting white water out. He stood straight for a few seconds before he fell down, his body split into two parts at the contact with the deck.","The wide deck of Judgment Day was empty. On the aft superstructure, one person could be seen using a water cleaner to wash the mooring cables. Wang looked down from a high vantage point to see the man stiffen just as the ship's components passed over him, and then the rubber-coated water hose snapped in two near by. Water sprays sprayed white from where it had splashed on to the ground. The man stood for a few seconds before collapsing. His body broke in two as it touched the deck.","The ship’s broad deck was empty except for a person washing his hands with the tap on the after deck, Yang Minxuan could see clearly from above as he watched the part of the ship that had passed over the steel pillars. The moment the ship’s section moved through the gap between them, the body stiffened when the water pipe fell out of his hand; the water flowed out of the hose at this point, splashing all over the place. He stood straight while touching the deck at the same time. His body split into two sections.","Judgment Day was empty except for the person on the rear deck cleaning the pylon with a water hose. As the ship moved across the archway between the pillars, Wang could make out the small figure moving along it, frozen until he knew it was dead. When the ship's part of the new steel structure passed close by, the man's body locked up. The hose fell from his hand. As soon as the two ends of the gray, dry rope were broken, sweatdroplets escaped in the distance. Another man stood stiffly on one of the bars, straightened out by the break, before landing right on top of him. His body had been divided into two, like the moisture seeping through between the cracks.","The wide deck of the ""Judgment Day"" was empty except for one person who was washing anchor cables with a faucet from the afterdeck. Hu Man understood clearly as he looked down from high above when the ship passed over the steel columns; the man's body stiffened instantly at that moment as if struck by some unseen force, his water faucet falling out of his hand; the nearby rubber hose also snapped in two as it hit the ground, spouting water white as milk from where it split; the man stood straight for several seconds before collapsing. His body split in two as he touched the deck.","There was a wide expanse of empty land between the superstructures, except for one person who was washing the mooring pins with a water faucet on the aft deck. Wang looked down from a high vantage point and saw the man's body jerk before he collapsed. The faucet fell to the ground as the ship passed over the steel pillars, breaking into two pieces, and white water sprays sprayed up. Wang could see the man's body split in two as it collided with the deck."

But suppose that of the thirty million soldiers forming the computer, each one is capable of raising and lowering the black and white flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster.

The Chinese proverb ""A bird in a barrel is sure to get struck by a bolt of lightning"" translates to ""The barrel of a gun will surely fire bullets"". This is because the speed at which the computer's data lines transmit information is much faster than the speed at which light travels through space or time. So if we assume that every person on the planet can communicate with each other instantaneously over their line of sight, then the speeds of the data packets would be very different from what you would expect in reality. This means that the system could become overwhelmed or slow down due to the sheer volume of information being transmitted.","Pan smiled. 'That's not bad. But if the number of soldiers in the world's computers were equal to three million, say one billionth of the total population of the world, moving flags at that speed for ten thousand times a second, you might different things.'","Pan Han revealed a mysterious smile: ""That's right, but if 30 million soldiers were constructed for computers, each of them could wave black-and-white flags 100,000 times per second on the computer network, the speed of the light cavalry would be several times or even faster than sound. The result would be different.""","Pan laughed mysteriously. 'No, but if we assemble three million soldiers, each of them using millions of colored flags to wave back and forth, there will be so much data flying through the network that lightning will be moving at least several times faster than the speed of sound (and maybe a lot faster). The result would be very different.","Pan Liexue said with a mysterious smile, ""That’s fine, but if we consider the 10 million soldiers on the battlefield who can raise banners at a speed of one thousand times the speed of sound or even faster, what results will be different.","Pan smiled. 'That's not bad. But if each of the thirty million soldiers of the world's population had been capable of waving the colors of a military battalion ten times in one second, the total assault force on a wide band of air would be much different than the current one, wouldn't it?","Pan Han smiled mysteriously: ""That's right, but if there were 300 million soldiers constituting a computer, each of them could wave black-and-white flags ten thousand times per second. The speed of light on the lines is several times faster or even faster than that.""","Pan laughed mysteriously.

只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。,"Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.","Just fathers, brothers, and cousins, which is according to the Fathers' instruction, I cannot violate or contradict it, so the brothers also do not have to go into great detail, but just want to give them a rough idea.","I follow the sacred traditions of the family which states that a man's place is to be son of God and not to denitrify his own status by giving his sons the same precedence as men. So when it comes to my relationship with my grandchildren I make no attempt to go over much, merely trying to set them straight on their parentage.","Just like father, elder brother, and brotherhood, they were bound by Confucius' teachings and could not violate them, so between brothers, it was enough for them to just get a glimpse of what is appropriate. They did not think that as men, they needed to be role models for their younger siblings.","But as Longer or Cousin were圣人的教诲， they had no need to disregard them; so, generally speaking, the brothers and sisters of these generations were able to carry on the family legacy, giving roughly construed versions of what would have otherwise been much more extensive and ornate accounts. We should be foolish if we thought that being a son or grandson we had to behave like an elder. It is enough for us simply to be ourselves, however.","Only the father, uncle, brotherhood, is forbidden to contradict or dissent from the ancient teachings of the Buddha, so there is no need to go into detail about them, but just want to make up for what you have done and not be a man to your children.","As far as I am, ' said Father, 'the rules by which Brother Qian's life has been lived since there is not to allow him to deviation. And so when it comes to my children, I leave almost everything to them to define me. I have no means of influencing them at all, save to say this: I wish them good luck. That is their duty, I think.","Only father, brother, and cousins, because they are inheritors of Confucius' teachings, dare not disobey them, so brothers simply abide by their general rules, without wanting to be a model for their children as men.","But it was modelled on the principles laid down by Confucius, and for that reason a son did not dare to违背 these. In fact, however, the rules of behaviour in this case were only sketchy. He was conscious, however, that he was no ordinary son, and that he therefore had the duty of being an example to his brothers."

They all have the same task: To lift Up the unhappy unhappy wife of trouble (the one of North Pole) and to Jump Into the freezing river (the one of South Pole).","At night, there is a gray grape vine, golden wind through the river, deep blue sky, and bright green stars. The two main stars of the Southern Cross – the Swordfish and the Dipper – represent death and life respectively. The Glass Crock – with one brick missing – represents a burning pot. The starry sky above the lonely farmer’s house is full of problems. He has to decide whether he should hang himself or jump into the river… They are all hanging over his head.","Under the dark sky, red windswept water channels crisscrossing the muddy river bed, sending down golden rays of dawn; deep blue stars shone far away, more brightly than the neighbouring Milky Way, and here and there there were broken tiles from a underground well, and, above all heaven, the lonely牛郎星 and the unhappy weaver waiting at the mouth of the well were held up by their magic links.","The night is gray with grapes, the wind carries a river of gold, blue skies shimmering undulating forever, green stars shine bright like diamonds. The compass star – the star that died, the constellation star – the constellation that was born; eight corner glass jars – one missing a piece of a brick, burning hot, the girl with the moon must be hanging up from the window. She is all over her head.","The night seemed to turn out dark blue, because of the cloudy wine-gold sky. The blue sky was unending. Green mirror stars were bright. The star of the七星座—the southmost main constellation was missing, the one of the eight corners—the one of the箕星—hung a mile away from the constellation's center, the one of the corner boulders—were all hanging from the head. And the other four corners—of the primeval Milky Way—the ones with the rose-shaped stars—were too bright.]","At night, there was a gray grape, golden wind passing by the river, deep blue sky with bright stars, and green stars were even brighter than usual. The North Star was like a spoon, while the South Star looked like a basket, and the Eight-angled glass well was missing a brick, so the anxious shepherd wanted to hang himself, while the sad maiden wanted to jump into the river… They were all hanging on the head.","Underneath the grey skies, golden windswept canals glimmer with gold, deep blue heavens so dark they seem infinite, and green stars more brightly shining than any on earth. All the constellations of these enchanted skies are held suspended above humans' heads: Cowherd hanging onto a rock,织女跳入河中的哀音……"

'Who could have sent this food round?' he wondered.","I was so excited when I saw that my brother was delighted with his meal, as he picked up a piece of red meat and ate it.

He didn’t have time to eat his rice as he had already eaten up his meal. The red-braised meat was very delicious because it tasted fresh even though the food had long been cold. He thought to himself: “I don’t know who sent these dishes.”,"What followed was a happy surprise as Trinket realized just how cold the food had gotten. Nevertheless he stuffed each large meat-cutlet with a mouthful a testament to his hunger into his mouth anyway, regardless of its deteriorated freshness.

'If they're not opened, you'll just starve to death.","He felt that he had won, his heart was happy, but the little lord would not speak, perhaps it was a pity, so he wanted to find out how to break her stone path, yet he did not know how to do it. He said, ""When you give someone the stone path, if you cannot open it, you will die of hunger!","But as far as he was concerned all along the length of the chamber the little count was unaware that there was this little confusion in his mind; but for the most part all along the length of the chamber he had been keeping a close watch on the Little Countess, and hoped that by some means or other she would reveal the truth to him to his relief; but however he might interpret the old testament he could not see how to do it. 'Well, if Her Ladyship gave me a headache,' he said, 'I shall probably not be able to feed myself for some time. It seems like a饥饿的毕现。'","He felt that he was superior, feeling very happy. However, since the young lady could not speak, it was somewhat disappointing. If one wanted to open her up, they did not know how to do so. He said, ""If you were given a point of pressure, if one could not open it up, would not one be starving to death?","Satisfied with his own enhanced status, he at first paid the girl no attention; but by the time he had worked out just how badly off she would be if he weren't there to save her, he found himself going round to her defence. He reflected that her inability to speak was making the situation all the more depressing for her, and he went up to her and began: 'If they've closed your pores, my dear, you'll starve; starvation's far worse than being blocked up. You ought to realise that!'","He felt he was in a good mood, but his heart was not happy; the little prince would not speak, that would be rather unfortunate, and he did not know how to get her out of her way, saying ""If you give me the key to my door, I will never eat again, what a pity!","But as far as he was concerned he was superior in every respect to the other two, and therefore seemed to be on the right side of the matter; but he had no knowledge at all of the methods by which the Little Countess would be allowed to open her wound. 'If you gave her a while to recover, you wouldn't be able to give her food until she's fully recovered,' he thought. 'It would be a grievous disappointment to her if she never recovered completely.'","He felt that he had won and was pleased with himself but he would be disappointed if he could not help her because she was too young to speak. He wanted to open her meridians but did not know how to do it. ""If you were to be made to eat something, what would happen? You might starve to death!""","He felt better as the girl ceased complaining. However, this seemed to have little effect on the latter, and though he very much wanted to help her (he had learned that it was extremely difficult but worth trying), he did not know what the best way was, and could only say: 'Someone's put you under a bandage. If you can't get them unbound, you won't be eating any more! It will kill you!'"

旁边伏侍的人只见他先还拿着镜子照，落下来，仍睁开眼拾在手内，末后镜子掉下来，便不动了。,"To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from his grasp, he finally ceased to move.","The person standing behind him was just watching him with his eyes on the mirror as it fell down, so he raised his head again and picked up the mirror in his hand.

When that was over, the mirror fell to the floor.","The attendant saw him first holding up a mirror, falling back down, then picking it up again with his hand. Finally, when the mirror fell, he did not move.","Observing this process, the person at her side saw first that she had it in her hand while she was being dressed, and subsequently that it had fallen to the ground; but finally, when she was done dressing up, her eyes became dead.","The person standing beside him is just watching as he held his mirror up first, and then it fell down, so he opened his eyes and picked up the mirror in his hand.

Then when the mirror fell, he did not move.","The attendant watched in astonishment as first he saw her looking into the mirror, then, as she fell back in her seat, it remained unblinking; but after that it dropped to the ground and was altogether dead."

他想着：“兄弟们一并都有父母教训，何必我多事，反生疏了。 况且我是正出，他是庶出，饶这样看待，还有人背后谈论，还禁得辖治了他？”,"'We are both equally subject to our parents' control,' he would say of himself and Jia Huan. 'Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife's son and he is the concubine's? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.'","He thought: ""My brothers have parents who also taught me, why should I do so? And then there's that, and I am a man of right, he is a woman of wrong; how can we view this with such an attitude, and still be talking about it behind his back?""","Well,' thought the boy, 'his parents must have gone down good memory on all three of them, so he could hardly hope to get any pleasure out of making a fool of himself; besides, I'm only as old as him, really. He can go off to raise his parents—but I shall just have to keep my opinion to myself, and if anyone tries to gossip about me behind my back, they will get me in监牢里！」","He thought, ""Why should I be the one to deal with it? It's better if I just let them handle it."" Furthermore, he was a natural son while his brother was a bastard child. He would rather they didn't speak ill of him, much less talk about him behind his back.","Things are worse than I feared,' was what Mr. Oi-poi was thinking as he finished eating. The boy had no such kin to discipline him; nor, being a child of higher birth, did he need attending to in quite the same way that he did. He could go as he liked, and even if anyone did talk behind his back, there was not much Master Yu-ming could do about it.","He thought: ""My brothers also have parents' instructions, why should I do more than they do? And besides being a man of honor, he is a poor outcast; what if we consider this differently? And could there be anyone behind me who talks about him or even controls him?""","That's very well said,' he thought. 'My parents and all of their brothers will have had their parents' instructions before they come here. What if, a year or two later, I came across one of my children who had been adopted? I shall be able to reply to them as best I can, but then nobody would dare accuse me for being mean. I can just keep on living my life as normal.","He thought: ""My brothers have also been reared by their parents; why should I be so troublesome? It's even more awkward that I am the eldest while he is the youngest.""","That's what I'm for!' thought Ogier. ‘Younger brothers have their parents to teach them; why should it be my fault if I don't know him? At any rate, though I am the main one coming out, he is the crudest of the lot; so even if there is any backbiting going on, there is nobody to boss me!’"

沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏幕上出现一条平直的绿线，“你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是2.726±0.010K，那个误差是银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。,"As he spoke, Sha typed quickly at the terminal. Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen. 'This curve is the real-time measurement of the overall cosmic microwave background—oh, calling it a straight line would be more accurate.

'As he says on the screen, you see a straight green line representing the currently known global cosmic microwave background.

好在吴佩珍是压得起的，她的人生任务不如王琦瑶来得重，有一点吃老本，也有一点不计较，本是一身轻，也是为王琦瑶分担的意思。,"It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her. This was partly because she had plenty of psychic capital to draw on, but also because she simply did not mind. Things came easy to her and she was willing to bear more than her share.","Good thing that Gao Pingxin is a weight-bearing woman. Her life tasks were not as heavy as Ooguri’s, but there was also some resentment, too. It was just one’s body, not the other’s. The purpose of being lighter than this was for her to share with Ooguri.","This was not a problem that Helmut wanted to solve alone. His tasks didn't seem as serious as Wang Qiyao's, who, having reached a point in her life where she was just another tired copy, but nevertheless had still given her share of happiness to others, took comfort in the fact that his responsibilities for her didn't burden him.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is not too heavy, and her life mission is not as heavy as Wang Qiuyue’s, so she can eat old meals, but also doesn’t care much, which means that she carries a lighter body, but also helps Wang Qiuyue.","At least Wu Peizhen had the luxury of not having to contend with as much as Wang Qiyao did. There was something flattering about her; she did not have the responsibilities that Wang Qiyao had. She ate from her own plate and tried hard not to complain—this, after all, was one way in which she served the role that Wang Qiyao played for her.","In addition, I think that Jie Pingxin is a strong one, not as heavy-handed as Wang Guirong. She was able to carry out her life task less than Ouyang Xue, which means she was carrying some weight for Wang Guirong's burden, too.",Fortunately Wu Peizhen was no pushover and her life tasks weren't as serious as Wang Qiyao's. Wu Peizhen may have had her assignments seem easy enough at first glance but she didn't care; all she ever did was pass on Wang Qiyao's pain.,"Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is able to take it. Her life mission is not as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's. She has a little old money, but she doesn't care too much. It's all about sharing.","Rui Peizhen was in a different category. She could afford to be impatient with Wu Peizhen's slow progress, since her life tasks were nowhere near as heavy. She ate from her savings, but also knew that there was no such thing as calculation; accordingly, she exerted herself even harder. Her share of Wang Qiyao's burden was lightened by her."

因见上面大旨不过谈情，亦只是实录其事，绝无伤时诲淫之病，方从头至尾抄写回来，闻世传奇。,He could see that its main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher.,"Because they did not just make a point of describing how things were, but instead recorded the facts directly; there was no harm in seeing through them or spreading them around like a virus; I will copy all this back from beginning to end, so that people can hear about it.","From this we learn that what Her Cry says concerns 'counseling a bride to choose her husband's course', and that all it records is 'a true account of the circumstances which led up to her visit'.

And what, I ask, a binding lesson of morality holds between us? That we all delight in telling one another tales of love.","Because the main point of this passage is not about romance but rather factual evidence; there is no illness of love at all, so I should just write everything back from head to tail. When we have a story that has been told over and over again, we will hear it.","From this we learn that the man had been told not to discuss love; and therefore, what he wrote down was strictly a record of what had actually happened, without any unhealthy elements of revenge or sensuality. He had merely returned the pages from the top to the bottom, eager to share his story with the world.","Because what is written above is not talking about love but just a record of events, there is no disease of slander or lust. I have copied everything from the beginning to end and will be published soon.""","Observing that the letter was concerned solely with the course of their conversations and that there was no scandalous or profane matter it contained, he decided to copy the whole of the diary down and publish it as a novel for immoral amusement."

'Today,' she began to say, 'I've brought my nephew to see you. I haven't come here in order to ask about your meal today. The weather is getting very cold and my father and mother don't have enough to eat. They've brought us here only because they're worried about me.'","This is how Liu Tao took care of his son, without any other reason, because he did not have enough food for his parents. The weather was cold and they had to bring him along with him as well.","There's no need for you to stay, old fellow,' said Grannie Liu: ''It is because my son has not had a meal and the weather is cold that I'm bringing him with me. He will get enough from his father's kitchen, though,' she continued, looking to her watch-moment as she spoke. 'If he were brought in straight, he would run the risk of getting sick.'","Liu's old man is settled down. He said, ""I brought your nephew today not for any other reason but because his parents don't have anything to eat. It's cold outside too so I brought him here.""","Grannie Liu took leave of him and set about preparing her travelling companion's lunch. 'I've come here purely for the sake of my nephew,' she said. 'His parents can't afford anything to eat. It's getting cold too.'"

""Don't be afraid, I won't kill you,"" she said.","Her face was filled with snowballing whitiness; her eyes, those of a paragon for beauty, were too close to close; and her long eyelids began to flutter. 'You don't need to worry about me, sir. I won't杀头。","The girl's cheeks were white as snow, there was not a hint of color on her face, her long lashes quivered constantly, she seemed very afraid.

I wouldn't dream of killing you.","Seeing her cheeks snow-white, there is no trace of blood on her face. The long eyelashes were twitching constantly, hoping she was scared. ""Don't be afraid, I won't kill you.""","She, naturally, had not enough blood in her body to be scared; but she was wearing a fearful expression on her face and long straight hairs quivering at her touch which she retaliated against with a charming smile: 'No fear! I won't do it to you.'","She was pale as snow with no hint of blood on her cheeks. Her long eyelashes were quivering constantly. She must be very afraid. ""Don't worry,"" she said cheerfully.","His next victim was a rather fair-skinned girl, whose cheeks were now free of blood, and her long eyelashes seemed to be trembling with fright.

一家四口，以务农为业。 因狗儿白日间自作些生计，刘氏又操井臼等事，青板姊弟两个无人照管，狗儿遂将岳母刘老老接来，一处过活。,"The four of them depended on agriculture for their living, and since, with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his wife busy about the farm drawing water, pounding grain, and the like, there was no one to look after Qing-er and her little brother, Gou-er invited his mother-in-law, old Grannie Liu, to come and live with them.","A family of four, who have been farming. For a while, their father had been managing the wellhouse work for his own interests. Their youngest daughter, Qingbao, was left in charge of the two sisters who were not taking care of them when they were out during the day. The dog then took the place of the elder sister, Tiaowu, who was unable to take care of her.","FAMILY AND FRIENDS: THE THOUSAND TROUBLELEYS OF GOD-ERFCENT IS WORKING AS A AGGREGATE FOR HOMELIFE. Because his activities with dogs during the day time were not well received by his grandparents, it was now decided that dog-days should be used as an means of livelihood for the family; yet there was no one among the girls who could look after Grannie Liu's affairs. So it was that dog-day had been transformed into a set of chores for the entire family, and thus Granddad's wife had been able to find ways to get about among them, even masquerading occasionally as workaday.","A family of four. They make a living by farming. Because the dog is making some money during the day, Liu's wife also does household chores. The two young girls have no one to look after them. So the dog has taken his mother-in-law Liu Old Mother from her son's home and they all live together now.","This was of old a family of two generations: Father, Mother, and twins Brother and Sister Yu. Because Gou-er had the ability to earn a living as a single man in the day-time and Grandma Liu was occupied with well-watering the fields in the evening, it was decided that she should be taken in by Grandmother Er and given a share of their income.","A family of four, with a career as farmers. For their own business, Tuan and his wife took on household chores such as digging wells and managing the yard tools. Qianbiao's two sisters were left alone when Tuan had to take care of her mother, Caiyue. Tuan brought Qianbiao over from day to night.","For four generations now this was the course of events: Yen-er, who laboured away in his time, employed himself in making a living, while Nannie and Tian-pat were looked after by two sisters called Qing-bao – no one of their own age could look after them properly, so dog-go had confided the responsibilities in the hands of its little brother Yu-cage and who spent his days making money together with his sister.","A family of four. They were farmers by occupation. Because the dog would make some money during the day, Liu's wife also had to do chores such as grinding rice and washing clothes. The two younger sisters couldn't take care of the dog because they didn't have anyone to look after them. So the dog brought his old mother to live with him.","The four of them—father, mother, brother Gou-er, and grandma—made a living from farming. Because day-after-day he found some way to waste time and energy (white-coloured bridle-bits had been the work of one such), Old Gou-trinked, taking advantage of the fact that the old woman's skills were more than sufficient to keep two young sisters busy with no one to look after them, brought her in to share their motherhood and livelihood."

平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。,"There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.","In the night of Peace Village, there were many thoughts too. But it was just that they didn’t have a large flower on the curtains of Ouyang Guo’s window. It was merely a display of it. Many thoughts were buried deep within them, like sediment. Everything was about survival. They squeezed out the sweat, dried off the water, condensed into blocks, how could their emotions be sustained?",平安里夜晚并非一个碌碌无为、毫无奢望可念的景象，而是许多人皆有心却都未能写进日志之中，甚至于窗幔上未见花般繁复艳丽的大朵花朵，也不得轻易显露出来，都在暗箱中默默沉思磨练，将一线一线的小物凝结成团，如何激荡也无法掀开。,"The night in the Peaceful is also full of thoughts, but it does not show through Wang Qi'ao's curtains with flowers, because there is no way to reveal them. Many thoughts are buried deep in the heart, like dust. They are all caused by daily life, squeezed out of their juices, dried up, and condensed into blocks. How can they rise?","In Peace Lane, however, everything has many possibilities, just that they never quite make it to the surface, much like Wang Qiyao's large flowers that do not have room to grow against the dark background. These are people and circumstances that must struggle every day to survive; after squeezing the juice out of their lives, the result is a substance so dry that it barely resembles its former self.","In the evening of Peace Village, there was also a lot of headspace for people, but no big flower on Wang Qiu'er's curtains. It is just a reflection of that. Many of these thoughts are hidden inside their hearts, like a thick layer of sand. All of them are laboring with money, draining sweat, condensing into something solid, how could they even stir up the waves?","Nighttime along Peace Lane is not all melancholy; one simply needs to look inside to experience it. There, as so many people would admit, there are few beautiful flowers on the curtains, and from which one mustality of thoughts be squeezed out and frozen for dear life, from which nothing rises to spring.","The night in Peaceful Place is also full of thoughts, but without the big flowers on Wang Qiaoyue's curtains, they cannot be revealed. Many thoughts are buried deep within one's heart, like a waste material. They all come from the pressure of living a life. The thought bubbles will not rise up because it has been squeezed dry and dried out.","But at night, everything takes on a new significance; there is no need for curtains to reveal it. Many a disturbing thought floats around in the air beneath Wang Qiyao's large flowers, hidden away somewhere deep down. Years ago, life back then was much tougher, but in the course of living out day after day, people had learned to filter out the激越，思想水分挥发，凝成一层坚硬的晶状体，却依然不堪重负，总是波澜迭出，翻腾不止。"
这种弄堂的房屋看上去是鳞次栉比，挤挤挨挨，灯光是如豆的一点一点，虽然微弱，却是稠密，一锅粥似的。,"Apartment structures are built virtually on top of one another, cheek by jowl, breathing down upon each other's necks. Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.","This shophouses look like a cluster of buildings, packed tightly and dimly lit. Even though it is faint, they are dense, just like a soup pot.","The Shanghai longtang look like ever-growing ditches: the curtains seem numbered; the streetlights shine one after another, faintly like grains; but even though they are few and far between, you can note their dense concentration.","The houses of this alleyway look like they are stacked on top of each other, crammed closely together, with dim light here and there, even though it is weak, it is dense, like a pot of porridge.","The sort of longtang in the city are arranged side by side, row upon row; they glow with a few glimmering lights, though even that glimmer is not spiky but dense, spreading out like a thick soup.","The apartment buildings appear like a series of rows of bricks with brick after brick, all packed tight together, while the lighting is just a dot on a dot, weak but dense.",The apartments of these longtang look like consecutive bumpers squeezed together into a分布式光线显然不是太强，却却密密匝匝的，如同很不紧不慢的一锅粥。,"This row house is like a maze, packed together with all kinds of people, lights flickering from here and there, even though it's dim, it is dense, like a pot of porridge.","Despite their density, the longtang apartments appear crowded with tiny lamps of scattered light, even though the total output is modest."
薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。,"'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.",薛蟠道：“要是不这样，我恐怕不敢冒犯：因为月末三天，是我的生日，谁知道老胡和老程他们，不知道从哪里弄来的：这样的粗，这样的长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大，这么大，大的西瓜；这么大，这么大，大名鼎鼎的暹罗猪、鱼。”,"I hope it's because,' said Xue-er, 'that you would have been surprised to discover my little plot; but I can imagine that the Reptiles and Amphibians you mean would have made quite a nice surprise for me: fifteen feet long! Two inches thick! Purely collection of purest most perfect purest most perfect fresh sweet potato chunks! Long legs! Large fish! And large potted herbs and plants—sweet cabbage, longosaurus from Thailand, or pangulas from China.","Wang Zhepan said, ""I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been forced to."" He continued, ""It was on the thirtieth of the lunar month that my birthday was; I didn't know where these guys were from until I saw them. These aren't ordinary people. They're not even peasants. They're like a big man with a long beard. The pork is so large that you could fit two or three pigs inside it. The fish is so big that it's as long as your arm.""","I wouldn't have bothered if it didn't concern Old Chai,' said Xue Pan. 'It all starts on the thirtieth day of the first month. Yesterday was my birthday, and now I hear old胡和老程他们带来了这些东西: a big, thin leek as thick as a dancer's thigh and as crisp as popcorn, and a big, long silkworm cake from Thailand; and some of those fucking Thai pigs and fish that they're letting in.",薛蟠道：“不然的话，我不敢惊扰到：只因为下月三日是我生日，谁知道老胡和老程他们哪里来的？这么细又这么长，像新鲜的藕那样脆，像大西瓜那样大，像暹罗国送来的香薰的暹罗猪、鱼。”,"If it were not for that I would not have bothered,' said Xiang Pan. 'But if I had known exactly what I was doing, I shouldn't have gone. I should have expected that by the month of January, Mr Jia and Mr Cheng would be back from their holidays, and that they would still be standing at the market offering their delicacies; that there should be huge heaps of fresh balsamic root, enormous plump Thai roots so long grown in the Phai Krong region of Thailand, giant pears so long grown in the Somnath Province of Vietnam.","Wang Zehua said: ""If I hadn't been there, I wouldn't have dared to wake you up either. It was on the 13th of the lunar month that my birthday was. I didn't know where those two old men had come from until today. They brought me this huge, long, thin, crisp, fresh water chestnut, a big, juicy watermelon, a long, fat, and very fragrant Siamese pig and fish.""","I wouldn't have bothered to wake you in any case,' said Xue Pan. 'It all arrives on October 9th. I don't know where they got it all from— old胡、老程他们带来的。这么糙，这么短！这么鲜美的脆藕，这么大个的西瓜, 这里送来的泰国大使馆送来的檀香猪肉、鱼。"

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her part, she has not spared any kind of belligerence; Prof. Liu also laid out a thousand promises on his pillow, and he vowed that no matter what happened, if the two countries were united, everything would be fine. But unfortunately, when they joined hands, it was their property that was taken over by the state. Only those who could stay with their private apartments in one place were entitled to heaven's mercy and earth's mercy. The garden flat had vanished from sight.","She not only gave her students a plethora of complaints, but that same Mr. Cheng also broke off all relations with the company, declaring his own home private and public property, and promising to share the fruits of his venture with the state if the joint enterprise were to be merged into the State. He even agreed to build a garden and mansion for himself in return for the share he'd gotten from the National Bank.","For this reason she had not stopped complaining, and Mr. Yan made a thousand promises and vows on his pillow, but unfortunately, when public ownership was established, all of his private property belonged to the state, so he could only retain one piece of land as his heaven and earth blessings, which finally became a mirage for his garden and villa.","She got upset enough that Mr. Wang agreed on one condition: All his possessions would be nationalized, but he promised to keep one small patch of land under his name as a token of the state's mercy. Until his dreams ended, the family lived with the thought that their private domain would one day be restored to them as long as they maintained the property.","She has complained a lot about him, and he has also made promises on her pillow, such as: ""I will not give up my promise to the government; I have promised to take care of my private property, so that I can still live in my personal house even after it becomes a public one. My garden and villa will be lost forever.""","She didn't mind venting her complaints, but Mr. Cheng had also promised to keep his word; to put his feelings aside, he could appreciate no fewer than a hundred+1 promises that his name would be recorded history and that his family would be able to call his home; but now, with the state enterprise being divided between the State and the Society, her feelings would never have been capable of holding out under such艰难的时运。","For this reason she had not ceased complaining, and Mr. Yin had made a thousand vows and ten thousand promises on his pillow; yet when the reform of public ownership took place, all his property was confiscated, and he could only hold onto a private house as a blessing from heaven and earth. The garden mansion would eventually become a dream.","She got mad at him more than once; and he made a thousand words and promises to me that if he could only keep his trap shut and the two of them get on like old times, he'd give up his socialism for her sake. But now, upon nationalization, all personal property was nationalized, and even though he had managed to hold on to his share of the garden, it was gone, and their dream of an apartment in the French manner had vanished into thin air."

韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。,The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.,"The young man who was strong enough to stand up by himself walked over with a determined look on his face, and the pain in his body could also be endured, which made his sister蕊初感到浑身疼痛无比， she couldn’t help but raise her voice in response.","Trinket appeared at Hushaicong's door again, this time with pain in his eyes. Butabella had more acquaintance with those old grunts than any; but when she asked him what was wrong, he gave a cry of some discomfort that told half the truth.","Wu Xiaoliao came forward with great effort. The pain he felt was bearable, but he could not help moaning as he realized that every part of his body ached.","Trinket took a page out of the old fighter's handbook and strode purposefully towards his enemy. By any standards he was in fine fettle; but against Rose, whatever was wrong with him seemed doubly painful. He winced.","Wu Zai Ba is a man of strength who has already walked up to him with his body's pain. When he asked Budewang if there was anything that could make him feel better, she said that her whole body felt very painful. She couldn't help but laugh when she heard this.","Trinket appeared at Hushaosun's door again, this time with pain in his eyes. But since Blossom had asked him, he came over. There was no need to complain about the pain in his eyes; all he could think was that there were so many other things he could complain about.","Wu Xiaoliao came over with a spring in his step, but he could not bear the pain for long as it was too much. He grunted in pain.","Trinket resumed his march with considerable spunk; but the pain in his limbs was such that a loud cry would have been unmercifully audible had it not been checked by a bolt of怒发冲冠的 determination. When he'd finished shouting, he hobbled on, silent but for the regular pain-soundings in his muscles and bones."
看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I was thinking of them when I had a small smile on my face. But something else made me happy. There were two women standing far away from me. They didn't hear what was said there. There was a woman in a sleepwear sleeping on one side, then on the other side she was sitting up and leaning over. Then there was another one who lay on half of her body, and the other half was lying on the ground. Her sleepwear covered her whole body, but it also had some weariness to it.","She sometimes had the feeling that the women would tell some of the stories she read, perhaps with a bit of excitement. Because they were far from being born-players, they could not hear what was going on behind them; but there was something a tad bitting about the woman as she lay in her bed, lying various ways—on her side, with her head rested on the table; and仰面朝天…… their thin, translucent bedding gave the room a sort of toasty feel, as if the author was being nudged towards it from time on.","There's a bit of pleasure as well as a little lust in his heart when he looks at them. Because they're standing far away, he can't hear what's going on there, so all he sees is a woman wearing her pajamas lying on the bed, with different positions: she's lying on her side, lying on her back, and lying half on her body while the other half is down on the ground. Her transparent pajama dress covers her body, and the bed has already creased up too.","But as they stood right up, their hearts were a little bit happier—but then they were starting to feel a bit peevish because they could not hear what they were saying. They could only see a woman lying back on the bed, turnsideup, and turning side ways, also being seen from above. One shot was from below, another from above, and the body beneath the covers was enclosed in a transparent robe that hung down to the floor. The whole thing looked a bit boring and stale.","I was a little happy, and I also had some kind of attraction to them. Because they were so far away from me, I couldn't hear what was being said there. There was a woman in a sleeping robe sitting on one side, laying down in a half position, and then in the other hand, she was lying upside down. She was wrapped around her body with her sleeping robe. Her sleep robes covered her whole body. The bed was slightly wrinkled, which made it feel a bit like there was something stuck to her.","She began to have a little hope, but before she knew it the women were no longer with her and the music they had once heard rise up from inside the room had disappeared. Still, all she could see was the woman herself, clothed in her sleeping robe, lying in various positions on the bed—on her side, maybe, with her head rested on the bed; on her hands, perhaps, with half of her body above the floor; and on the other half with its own form, probably bent over the floor. The dampening effect of the translucent curtain reminded her of some mild pleasure.","I felt a bit of happiness as well as some eroticism. They were standing too far away to hear what was happening there, but they could see a woman lying on her back, with different positions: side, front, half sitting up, half lying down. Her sheer nightgown covered her body, and the bed had wrinkles in it as well.","But as they stood off a bit, Wang Qiyao felt a bit of jealousy, though she made herself clear that it was silly of her to feel that way. The women sat on the edge of the bed, their legs crossed; they did not appear to be having any sex, but Wang Qiyao could not make out what they were saying because they were too loud for her to catch all of it. She could see the woman lying back, her heads turned towards the ceiling, one position with her upper body over the side of the bed, another with her lower body off the ground, and a third with her legs bent and her face up. All of them had been done from below. Her sleep mask completely covered her body, the bed was obviously in disarray, and the room seemed to be filled with the sound of sex."
