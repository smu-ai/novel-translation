次日天未明时，刘老老便起来梳洗了， 又将板儿教了几句话； 五六岁的孩子，听见带了他进城逛去，喜欢的无不应承。,"Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn. As soon as she had washed and done her hair, she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great house – an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city.","The next day at dawn, Liu Geowon got up early and washed himself. He also taught him some more words. Five-year-old children heard he was going to go to the city and like to follow him.","Three or four hours before this, Grannie Liu had risen early and awoke Qing-er on purpose for an inspection of the rising sun; and using no less than forty or fifty servants to carry out her directions, all of them had been given just as much as they could handle.","At dawn the next day, Liu Langlang got up to brush her teeth, then taught boarder a few sentences; five or six year old children like him liked his company when he was taken to the city for a tour.","But by some miracle of preparation, Grannie Liu rose sometime before daybreak and proceeded to groom herself with care. She instructed Ban-er in a few words of the language of the city and, making him promise his simple assent to all these assertions, brought him out with her to go shopping.","On the second day after dawn, Liu Geong woke up at a certain time in the morning, and taught him some words on his board; he had five-year-olds who heard him come out of town and liked him very much.","But not till very early in the day did she rise up and begin to brush her hair, to recite the utterances she had been given to her by Her Grandson before they set off for work, and to promise to return them our promises on their visit; and when she returned to her room she made no distinction whatever between boys and girls who were to be taken in with her to the city; and it was with delight that the little girl departed with him to their new home.","The next morning, Liu Lao got up early and washed himself. He taught him a few words as well. A five or six year old boy, hearing he was taken with his father to go to town, would say yes without thinking.","When he awoke, at about daybreak, she had already been up for some time and was now dressing herself and telling Ban-er a few things or two. A five-year-old child could answer quite a lot by heart and being taken along with his grandmother to go out in the country and visit friends was enough to enchant him.","The next day, after dawn, Liu Geong woke up at three o'clock in the morning. He got dressed and taught a few words to his son. The six-year-old children heard him taking him to the city, and he accepted it gladly.",First thing that made him up and go out of his bed was Grannie Liu's directions for him; he was required to repeat them to the chamberlain when he went out again. An eight or nine-year-old girl with a good memory responded without shame to her teacher's instructions.,"At dawn on the second day, Liu Laolao got up and washed his face. He also taught him a few words. A five or six year old boy likes going out with his father.","But she didn't begin to wake her again until the sun was high in the sky.

钱老板道：“是，是，多谢香主。” 在一张椅上坐了，续道：“属下将小郡主藏在猪肚里带进宫来，一来是为瞒过宫门侍卫的重重搜检，二来是要瞒过沐王府众人的耳目。,"'Thank you, Master,' said Butcher Qian, seating himself in one of the chairs and continuing. 'There were really two reasons why I hid the Little Countessinside this pig's carcass. One was to get her past the Palace Guard: they always search everyone at the gate. But it was also to get her past any of the Mu Family spies who might be out watching for us.","Money, do you say? Yes, I am grateful."" The money man sat down on a chair. He continued his speech, ""The underling has been hidden in the pig's belly in the palace and brought in as a prisoner, so that it will hide behind the eyes of the guards in the palace and the ears of the people in the royal family.","Any more, sir,' said the butcher. He sat down on a chair and began his account. 'At any rate,' he added after a silence, 'to summarize everything I told you before: first of all I concealed this little princess in one of the pig's feathers and inside him was the room by hiding it among other chickens in the palace; secondly, I wanted to hide my family from the guards at the gate and the people within the Palace so that they couldn't discover our secret.","Boss Qian said, ""Yes, yes, thank you."" He sat on a chair and continued, ""I brought my little princess into the palace through the belly of a pig. One reason is to avoid being searched by the palace guards; another reason is to avoid arousing suspicion among the沐王府众人.""","Of course,' said Butcher Qian eagerly. He sat himself down in a chair and continued: 'I took the Little Countess to live in my pigs' belly when I came here from the Palace. First of all it was to avoid being searched by the Palace guards; but mainly so that I could keep it from people like the Mu Family.","Money said: ""Yes, yes, thank you for your kindness."" He sat on a chair and continued: ""I have been sent by my superior to hide his little lady in the pig's belly, so that I can deceive the guards of the palace, and also deceive the people who come to the Chu Family.","If you wish to thank him, he is,' said Butcher Qian, seated on one of the salient chairs. 'He was afraid you might追问原来的情况，所以将郡主装在这只猪肚子里面溜进皇宫来。","Mr. Yang said, ""Yes, yes, thank you very much."" He sat on a chair and continued, ""My lord sent me here because he wanted to hide the princess in her stomach. One reason was to avoid the palace guards' thorough searches; the other was to keep their ears open from my lord's men.""","Yes,' said Butcher Qian. 'We're glad if they have gone.' He sat himself down in a chair again and continued: 'We hid her in one of the pig's bellies and brought her into the Palace. One thing was to avoid being searched by the Palace guards; and the other was to avoid arousing the attention of the Mu folk.","Money said: ""Yes, yes, thank you."" He sat down on a chair and continued, ""I will send the lady of the house under the pig stomach to the palace to hide her in, one is to deceive the guards who search the palace gate, and two is to deceive the people of the palace.","Well, well, well,' said Butcher Qian on the chair as he sat down at a table: 'if you will take the trouble to continue your account, I think I know enough about it to tell you everything that occurs in my presence. First of all, I concealed this little gem in the pig's belly inside my sash, so that when the Gate-of-Douglas men try to check it up again tomorrow morning, they shall find it missing; and secondly, I hope to trick their intelligence by disguising my踪影在这儿。","Boss Quan said, ""Yes, yes, thank you very much."" He sat on a chair and continued, ""My lord sent me here because he wanted to hide the young lady in the stomach of a pig. The first reason is to avoid the search by palace guards. The second reason is to prevent the ears of Lord Mou from being disturbed.""","Yes,' said Butcher Qian. 'We're all grateful to you, Master. We'd used a similar plan with our other two girls, but they were much younger; and it was to avoid giving away the location of our hold that I took her secretly here."

不过属下胆大妄为，事先没向韦香主请示，擅自将小郡主带进宫来，给韦香主增添不少危险，不少麻烦，实在该死之极。”,"Of course, it was rather a nerve, taking it on myself to bring the Little Countess in here without consulting you. It means a lot of danger for you, Master. And trouble. I deserve to be hung.'","But his subordinate was bold and rash.

This is beyond death!","But I took the initiative, didn't I? I've never sought to obtain any permission from Sir Wei before taking this Little Countess with me. Now she's added such a great deal of danger to my life, so it is that much more due to me.'","But for my reckless behavior, I should have asked for permission from Vashan before taking the young lady into the palace. It is a great sin to add danger and trouble to Vashan's life.","But as I said before, I took risks when I went in there unannounced; I caused a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to Master Wei, and I admit I should have been silly if I didn't.'","However, the subordinate is rash and bold, and did not inform his superior before entering the palace.

是以贾环等都不甚怕他，只因怕贾母不依，才只得让他三分。,The latter – Jia Huan included – reciprocated with a healthy disrespect only slightly tempered by their fear of his doting grandmother.,"Thus, the characters do not fear him too much, because they were afraid that his mother would not be obedient, so he was reduced to a third.",This was why there was no fear among the other members of the household that he were worth more than a nominal discount: it was simply because Grandmother Jia had made a practice of refusing him any favours on account of his status.,"Because all the other boys were afraid of him too, they didn't take his threats seriously, but they were afraid that if they didn't obey him, their mother would scold them.","From this arose a sort of compunction in Grandmother Jia's mind towards Jia Huan; for he was too young to censure him for what he had done, but he warned him that if he wished to keep his relations with the family, he should not cross them. Jia Huan understood this to mean that he was to avoid going anywhere with them unannounced, which was hard on him as they were his only friends.","Thus the characters of Jia Ling and others were not afraid of him, because he was not to be trusted by his mother. He only had a third when she did not approve.",This was why there was no fear among the other members of the family that he existed; but it was because Grandmother Jia insisted that he should have a look before he could claim a look-down on them that they were all in such a state.,"Because none of them were afraid of him, except for being afraid that they would not get along with the old lady if she refused, they could only give him a little respect.","So that although theyJia Huan and the others thought him aY Jia Rui had said something alarming to Jia Mother about their not wanting to be humiliated by him, he was constrained to make an exception for them because he feared upsetting her.","Thus, the people who do not fear him were all too timid; only because he was not respected by his mother, did he have to give up half of what he had.","This was why there was no fear among the cousins that Jia Yun's权限过大, but it was because Lady Jia insisted that he should only have a few divisions.","Because Zhao Hang was not afraid of him, but because he was afraid that Ji zhu would not agree, they could only let him have three points.","So that not even the most ambitious of them all, such as Jia Huan, took him for an enemy, but on the whole he restricted his attacks to those who might justly deserve him, being afraid that if he offended Jia Rui's mother she would withhold her support from him."

He didn't expect that this blade was so sharp, cutting meat like slicing noodles. One slash down, it wasn't even close to reaching the blade.","The butcher took the dagger鞘手, struck the beast with the blade, and there was血腥飞溅。 As it went slicing the animal, the point of the dagger flew through the animal's skin and left a gaping wound that not long after turned up dead.","Mr. Qu took it over. With a swift cut across the pig’s back, he found that this dagger was as sharp as a knife.

A single strike would have left it in pieces without even touching its blade.","The butcher took the dagger between his teeth and slashed the animal with all his might. A pork cut though this was made out of soft flesh, the old eunuch cut it with a razor-blade and went straight through the bone.",Mr. Yang took it over and cut it across the pig's back with a knife. He did not expect that this dagger was so sharp and could slice through pork like tofu. The blade of the sword went all the way down to the hilt.,"But but but why have you brought a dagger out here?' screamed the butcher, as it sliced through the meat with unerring accuracy and left a sharp edge of bloodstained metal at the end.","Mr. Yan took it up and stabbed his horse with a single slash, not expecting the blade to be so sharp. It cut the pork like peeling an orange peel. A single strike hit its center.""","The butcher took the blade in and slashed the carcass from the back of the pig. The刀锋毫不客气,毫不留情地切割猪皮,将瘦肉如豆腐片般分成两半。",Mr. Qu took it over and cut a slit on the pig's back. He didn't expect the dagger to be so sharp that he could cut the pork as easily as cutting tofu. The blade went all the way through his shoulder.,"Butcher Qian caught out its handle. He hadn't counted on the blade being so sharp; a slice across the back of the pig meant more than a cut across a piece of pork cut with a knife shaped like a cleaver. In fact, a few strokes along the back of the beast proved enough to saw it in two."

While Wang's mind raced, he could never focus on anything but the green line.","Then they sat at a bar open for tourists all night, sipping beer after beer, until Xiaoshan was talking more than ever before, while Wu Miao had already lost his mind and kept seeing that green line in his head.","Later they sat in a night club open to tourists where Sha could down glass after glass of beer, becoming more talkative, while Wang's mind was racing with images of that green line.","And they went to a bar for two hours at night, pouring themselves a beer each time they entered. They became more talkative and, unlike Lu Miao, had lost his mind; he kept thinking about that green line in his head.","Then they headed to the bar where tourists frequented, drinking multiple cups of wine after the other visitors drank their own. Sha drank more alcohol as he became increasingly sociable, while Wang's mind continued to drift through increasing numbers of memories of that green curve.","Then they sat for over two hours at a bar open for tourists, Shassir drinking beer after beer while becoming more talkative, while Wang Miao had already been worried sick inside his head as he kept imagining that green line.","So they sat for over two hours at a tourist-oriented bar.

虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。,"Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Although my grandmother is also a harmonious couple with him on his side of the rice field, and in that solemn and solemn period where they were both sorrowful and happy together, I do not have any charge, but it was indeed a proud father of the highland East of the Northern Plains, but then it was just a single man's marriage ceremony as a wedding partner, and there was quite a degree of randomness and instability. Moreover, I did not come from soil yet, so I called him ""Luo Xue Qing"" more accurately when writing about the things at that time.","Even though my grandma had already been blossoming in the sorghum fields under the direction of her father, who was a single man from Northeast Gaomi Township, where she was a married man who at once shared pain with me and at the same time compensated Granddad for his crime, she still held a certain elegance and refined refinement in those highland northeast villages where, when the soil rested on her head, she was a married wife who, having been adopted, felt at once relief and annoyance toward my grandfather. Also, despite the fact that he hadn't born any children, by which time it was already possible to call him Cousin Amtu more appropriately.","Although my grandmother had been harmoniously married with him in the field of corn, she was still happily pregnant at that time, but despite her being a half-dirty, half-fortunate father, I should call her a single house wife who was engaged in marriage by the family. My grandfather had been married to her as well, so it was not very stable or fixed, and even though my father hadn’t fallen off the earth yet, I shouldn’t use his name.","Even though Grandma had consummated her love for Yu Cang in the sorghum field, reaching harmony and happiness, she remained a half-crazed, half-cursed child born of a father who walked among the gourd fields of Northeast Gaomi Township — a man who, like his father before him, had been tied to his wife and loved unconditionally. But Grandma was not a virgin; she had not fallen into debt to society. So, even when it came time to write about this period in her life, I called her by the name of her father, Yu Cang.","Although my grandmother was already happy with her in the field of the wheat as part of a solemn ceremony that had been both painful and joyous, I, too, was pregnant with my guilt and righteousness but was still the father of the high plains of East China, a father who was also a married mother in the countryside, and whose husband always belonged to the spring and autumn fields, and there were a certain degree of randomness and instability between them. Furthermore, I did not descend from the earth, so when writing about those things at that time, I called him ""Rema Quan"" more accurately.","Even though she'd already been凤凰三起三落, that joyful mixture of joy and sorrow, she was still one of the few bright sides of the Sorghum Field, where, like my grandfather, she had been married to a fair maiden. And while my father had not borne children, at the time he could have called her my father's concubine; therefore, the topic of our conversation would always have been related to him by the use of the informal term.","Though my grandmother had already made peace with him in the tall grasses, she was still in a half-frightened/half-delighted state in that solemn process when I was pregnant with her guilt mixed with praise. Although my grandmother did carry my sin and praise, she was still a father of the East Jinxiang generation, but at that time, she was still a single wife married by legal marriage to a man from the family of Mengjia, who always had some degree of freedom and chance. Furthermore, my father hadn’t fallen off the ground yet, so it is more accurate to call him Yu Quanliao then.","Although Grandma had consummated her love for him in the sorghum field, she had not completed the sin-and-cleansing equation; so I grew half-evil, half-happy. Even though she'd become a full-time mistress of the single-family Zhou clan, she had not finished the task of making him father number one. But it was true that he had been married against his will, with quite a bit of accident and arbitrariness involved, and that the relationship between them had been based on trust and faithfulness—so much so that he hadn't even fallen back into俗(土)习惯。 So, when it came time to start calling the action in question, I thought it best to stick with 'Yu Zhan' rather than the more correct 'Yu Zhan (geng er)'.","Although my grandmother was with him in the rice fields of happiness and sorrow, it is true that he has been harmoniously married to me in a solemn moment where we both have our own crimes and virtues, but at least I am his father, but when she was single and had no parents, there were some degree of randomness and instability, which makes her a mix of a single man's traditional marriage and the combined household of the palace. She always carries the baggage of a mixed household as well as the baggage of the palace. In addition, I don't know if I fell from soil or not. So when writing about this time, I still call him ""Luo Quang He"" more accurately.","Even though she had already undergone the ecstasy of metamorphosis from a Native of the Northeast to a married wife of a reputable member of the Fang clan, her pregnancy was actually the child of the painful pain of an ascetic from the northeastern country, where she herself had suffered from madness and injustice. Before Granddad, his moral compass disturbed by this sudden beauty and his sense of loss after his sister's death, he had chosen notably two of his sisters as his bridesmaid; therefore, when it came time to write about what happened later on, we called the novel's main protagonist Yu Zhan'ao the 'wandering matchmaker.'","Though my grandmother was already married with him in the field of sorghum grain, she still had a happy time there in that half-bitter/half-delicious solemn process, though she also carried some guilt for it. My grandmother was still single and married by her family, and I am not sure if they were married by legal ways or not, but they did get together, so it's natural to call them as husband and wife.","Although Grandma had borne my father peacefully within the sacred union she entered into with him in the sorghum field, she had not remained his innocent wife; on the contrary, she had been a man of作风, and, because she was married to a single child of northeastern Gaomi Town who had no other male spouse besides her brother Yu Zhan'ao, Granddad could not have had a stable life with her. But Grandma had not stayed put: she had left her northern home and gone south with her husband, becoming one of those lovers whose activities are not defined by geographical boundaries. Moreover, Grandma had not fallen into place; on the day she gave birth to me, she did not even have a baby boy but a girl. So, when it came time to begin writing about our family's early years, I continued to call her husband Ye Zhan'ao, although calling him by his real last name — Yu Zhenghe — seemed more appropriate."
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”,"This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'","He was delighted. He said, ""Ah, just a pile of dung on the right face, no one will pay for that, so why not carve a pig? It's very expensive but it will surely make money.""","I'm markedly pleased, he said, munching on some cow dung, 'So I think I'd prefer to draw a cow on the right face instead of one of stupid pigs--that's what I've been told.'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Well, I'll carve a pile of dung on my left side, as no one will pay for it. Why not try something else? A pig would be nice – fat and stupid.""","All right,' he said, 'I'll put some on the right cheek. Now, there's a job for someone who wants something done. Maybe no one will buy any, but maybe they will want a pig. Pigs are big and stupid, so it should be a money-making job.'","He was very pleased, saying, ""Yes, there's a heap of dung on the right side; no one will buy it up, so let's just make a pig. It'll be good business.""","I'm really getting a few bucks for it, he said, smiling. 'Yeah, right your face with a bunch of buffalo dung. No one's willing to pay for you, but maybe you'll see good business.'","He is very pleased and says, ""Hmm, put a pile of dung on my left cheek, no one will buy dung, let's put a pig there instead, it's fat and stupid, so business must be good.""","I am very pleased,' said the stone cutter, 'because now I have a great business opportunity. A牛粪!'","He was so pleased. He said, ""Oh yes! You can't get a pig for a pig's粪，why not make one with a pig? Then you will definitely make money.""","Well, right on your face you'll draw a big bunch of cow dung, so nobody is willing to buy some out of the store. And don't forget your heart of all healers—people will go looking for you if they think they can get enough free labor from a pig.'","He was very pleased and said, ""Ah, well, right side, pile of dung, no one is willing to buy it, so let's carve a pig instead. It is fat and stupid, thus its business will be good.""","That should do it,' he said to himself, as his satisfaction was increased by the effect of his words on Old Geng. 'A cow to boot!' He proceeded to carve a cow with great ceremony from some of his finest materials."

道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。,"Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.","On both sides of the road, there is a layer of brown stalks, tightly intertwined and unbreakable. They crowd together and stare at each other, grayish-white stalks that do not have any difference with one another. The high粱穗子毫无办法分辨彼此，每一穗都充满活力，仿佛潺潺流水一样。","The sorghum was a dense layer of strong, unyielding walls, so impenetrable that they could not even tell the distinction between two rows—seagreen stalks sleepingely unaware of each other. The river's course seemed to go on for ever.","On either side of the road, the tall corn was blocky and static. It formed a solid mass, with each grain looking at every other one. The green corn stalks were still asleep, unable to distinguish themselves from their neighbors. Corn grew without end, like a flowing river.","The lines of sorghum along the road, solid and rigid like blocky building blocks, squeezed together for added stability, provided no clues as to whether they ended or not. The stalks contained no distinction between one another, nor could you tell from looking at them that they grew in an endless stream.","On either side of the road, rows of wheat, dense and rigid, connected together, crowded and squeezed, each examining the other, green wheat stalks sleepless, unable to distinguish between them, and the grain never stops flowing, as if a continuous river.","The sorghum on each side of the road was in lockstep, unmovable, like a wall of alternating brick blocks. Their grain-snap surfaces were as hard as greasy石膏涂料，hardly distinguishable from one another above all except under high temperature conditions. The sorghum, by sheer thickness, went on and on, as crooked as a canyone, indistinguishable from the next without proper lighting.","On either side of the road, rows of tall corn stalks were solid, dense, and crowded together, gazing at each other from afar. Their leaves had yet to open up, and their corn heads could not be distinguished. Corn was endless, like a flowing river.","To either side of the road lay a solid, rigid field of sorghum, packed so紧密, that any two grains of which could be distinguished only by chance. The green stalks, still closed against life, had no way of knowing that they were surrounded by the flowing river of yellow earth, for the flow was too swift.","On both sides of the road, high cobs are sturdy and impenetrable, forming a solid wall, covering up each other. Each cobbler looked at them with curiosity, staring blankly into the eyes of the other cobbler. The green grain of rice on each cob was closed and sleepy, unable to distinguish between them. This rice had no end, as if it flowed like a river.","The sorghum was dense and impenetrable; you could only examine each individual grain, covered in a green film, from which it could be distinguished simply by color—grasses, on either side of you. The sorghum绵长无穷，like a flowing river.","On either side of the road, the high grain blocks are rigidly packed together, forming a dense crowd. They look at each other with sleepy eyes. The green ears of the high grain are still sleeping. There is no end to the high grain; it looks like a river that flows continuously.","In front of us, the dark red sorghum road was split by parallel rows, solid and rigid like a mathematical abstraction, squeezed in between towering stalks that stared sleeplessly, their greenish yellow heads open-mouthed with anticipation, it was impossible to tell whether they were here or there, as the line of eternities flowed on like a moving river."
可巧凤姐正在上房算了输赢帐，听见后面一片声嚷，便知是李嬷嬷老病发了，又值他今儿输了钱，迁怒于人，排揎宝玉的丫头。,"Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia's room totting up the day's scores for the final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment. She identified it immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more, taking out on Bao-yu's unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses.","It is quite possible that Miss Gu is calculating the outcome of their bet on the other side, hearing the voices from behind. She was sure that Mr. Qian had aged badly, and he would have been angry with him for losing money today. He was also resentful of his daughter's丫头.","Jia Rui, attention paid to a账务收支之事，在背后说道:「王夫人要诊病的时辰，刚才刚过，病人早已在门外叫了起来。原来他娘子已突发大病，这是正好当儿输完了钱，要李嬷嬷的，她却一向是最忠厚最能解人之情的人，见了人就排仇的，要搬弄神通给宝玉打针的 !","Chic Jingxiao was just calculating the winning and losing account upstairs when she heard a commotion behind her.

他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”,"Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes. 'You're just like I imagined. Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.'","He changed his image on the media and wore a suit, appearing refined and handsome. He was ""as you imagine it"" - that is, he was elite and well-respected; its contents and essence were common knowledge for most people; but the level of knowledge required to understand it was too low.","Instead, he adopted a refined air of propriety that didn't look dirty but clean-lined and fashionable. 'You're not different from the people on Three Body All Born To Live In The Real World,' he said. 'We aren't like the ordinary people; we're top-class individuals. Three Body isn't only for those who know about scientific facts and mathematics—being able to understand concepts at that sublimacy of knowledge requires a true genius.'","He had changed his usual dirty homeless man look on TV, now he was dressed up in a suit, looking elegant, ""We are similar to you guys, we are all elites. ‘Three body’ is for your kind of people. Its contents and意境, ordinary people can’t understand; knowledge needed to play it is at a high level and its depth is also beyond what common people could have.""","He changed back to a clean-shaven street bum as usual, but this time with a difference: a suit and tie. His new appearance gave him a refined air. 'You are probably right,' he said, his voice carrying a certain aura of authority. 'As the Three Body was prepared for the elite, it is a must for us. The depth of meaning and the sophisticated mind required by the game are above the understanding of common people.'","He changed his image on the media from a man of dirty clothes to a well-dressed gentleman, wearing a suit and looking elegant. He said that what he imagined was similar to what people in his class expected, ""They resemble me as much as you do. They are all elite professionals; this is for you, a class that you cannot comprehend, its essence and意境是普通人无法理解的。""","The man changed significantly. He wore clean clothes and a整洁西装， but had the air of a former-classy wanderer. 'Not you, Three Body,' he said, the characters were not adapted for the men who worked in the media. But there is something about you that sets Three Body apart. To be a specialist in Three Body means being an exceptionalist. You need vast knowledge in areas beyond your comprehension; to be able to understand something so basic as three hundred thousand readiedly compiled by scientists as a secret weapon against space-time illusion.'","He has changed his usual dirty street urchin look on TV screens for a well-dressed dandy, ""You guys are just as I imagined, all of you are elites. ‘Three Body’ is for people like you. Its contents and meanings are beyond your comprehension; what you need to know about it requires a level of knowledge that is impossible for you.""","Dressed in a suit and leather shoes, he looked as stylish as a celebrity. 'You wouldn't believe how similar you are to me,' he said, changing into his old self. 'We're all the same, you know: the elite.' He continued, 'Three Body was prepared for people like us. Although the game is hard, its profundity and inner beauty are beyond understanding by common folk. And the knowledge required to play it is extremely advanced, deep as well.'","He changed his appearance on media in a way that was more of a downtrodden street criminal, wearing suits with a polished look. He seemed like a gentleman, ""You and I don't look alike, we're all elite professionals, and the novel Three Body is for your kind. Its depth and meaning are difficult to understand, and it requires knowledge from people who can't comprehend it.""","The man adopted a refurbished 50s fashion of wearing clothes properly dressed, but had a clean appearance; 'You, well you're as sophisticated as usual. Our The Three Body series must be appreciated not merely by experts, but by people like us who aren't experts . . . You have to acquire knowledge required to understand it, and the depth of content you need to explore is beyond what ordinary people can't afford.'","He has changed his usual dirty homeless man image on the media, now wearing a suit, looking very dashing. ""You guys are just as I imagined you to be, all of us are elite people, and ‘The Three-body Problem’ is for you, its contents and meaning are not something that common folk can understand; what you need to know about it is at the highest level, and the depth of its content is also beyond what ordinary people can have.""","Dressed now like a well-dressed street urchin, he had changed completely from his usual grimy image on television. His language was refined, and he seemed polite and successful,' he said, 'like me. I imagined you were all kind of weirdos. That's why The Three Body is meant for you. You who understand the depth and meaning of the game and the high level of knowledge it requires.'"

Writing at his dictation Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong.","Jiā yé yīn qǐ chū, zǎo bǎ sì chéng, lái kàn jiē qù ào zhě, wò jǐ yǒu ào zhú.

He then drew a 'loop' on the other side of which he said he would lend the other three words to use as he pleased. Jia Qiang received his papers by turning them over on a sheet of paper and holding them up like this: 'I've borrowed twenty taels of silver to spend a while at Green Delights. I'll spend the rest here.",Jia Rui got up and wrote out paper and ink. He wrote a hundred pieces of silver on it. He signed his name with his father’s name and sealed the document.

Then he tore up Jia Rong.,"When Jia Qiang threw himself from the bed, papers were already ready at his feet, so Jia Rui proceeded to make his bargain as follows: Fifty taels of silver and two drawings of a handprint on the promissory note would constitute his payment.

He handed them to Jia Rong and asked him to write something. They made no progress at all. In the end, they wrote fifty two pieces of silver and drew a bond. Then, he threw away Jia Rong.","When Jia Qiang threw himself back down, there was still time for Jia Rong to make a bargain: how much should we write? Fifty taels! Jia Qiang nodded, and they parted company, the former taking charge of Jia Rong's possessions while the latter left to tear up the paper.","Jiārén qiú chū yǒu gǔ jiàn, zǎo běng zhào kē jǐng, qù wèi xià xīn.

这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。,"It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.","The people who claim they are the ""Master of香气"" are simply making up their own nonsense by saying things like ""We have no idea what your will is, but we must obey it"". The real reason behind this is that each person already has a plan of action inside their minds. They just hope for someone to agree with them, so they do everything under the nose of the ""Master of香气"". In the future, they won't be involved in important matters at all.","It is their elders who stand as祭司口头的神甫, who tell us what to do in accordance with his commands. But all along the way the boys have been默守其政, silently determining what they really wish from him—and all the while they have been secretly preparing their own replies should their master decide. By which time it is too late for them to appeal to him; and they simply let it drop, knowing that he shall now be the centre of every discussion.","These people, who call themselves ""masters"" and say such things as ""waiting for a master's orders"", really have their own minds already. They just want to get their approval so that they can avoid any major responsibilities. Therefore, once these people are blamed, they will not be held responsible at all.","These eunuchs talk with their mouths about how they await their master's instructions; but deep down they all have their own ideas and are merely waiting for Trinket to give them an order. Once he is satisfied, all responsibility for the actions that will follow falls on Trinket. From then on it is up to him how far they go.","The people speak of themselves as a ""Chen Master"" and make all sorts of promises that they will be given instructions from the Chen Master one day, but their hearts have no idea what they should do. They just hope for approval, which is why everything falls on them. The Chen Master will not be responsible for anything significant.","It is the same with the people speaking of their Master. All they say when anyone else asks them what their instructions are are 'May I have your services?'—'I expect you will give me such and such a order.' But all they imply inwardly is, 'I wish I were your Comrade-remain unimproviated.' They have already long formed their own opinions about who their task was and what lay ahead of them. They merely hope that their master will agree with them—and this greatly depends on their agreeing． . . . In the end it is the individual who endorses Whiskers who carries on the business of transporting the Prince to his quarters—that is, to speak frankly—a task which involves no great importance, and who therefore takes no credit for himself at all.","These people spoke of themselves as the Master of Incense when they were speaking with their mouths full, saying things like ""waiting for a master's orders."" In fact, each had already made up his mind. He just wanted to get it approved by the Master of Incense so that he would not be held responsible for any major issues later on.","These eunuchs always refer to themselves as 'Aroma Main Man' and, whenever they talk about waiting for their master's instructions, are thinking up all sorts of things to do while he is away. All they want is for him to agree to be their mistress, and then all manner of mischief they could get up would be shifted on to someone else's conscience -- yours, Master, in this case.","The people who speak of themselves as the Master of the香气， talk about what they should be waiting for from the香气 Master's orders; in fact, each person has already got a plan in his or her mind, just hoping that he or she will get approval from the香气 Master, so that one day they won’t have any major responsibility.","These men would all be given the jibber-jabber of 'Master of the Society' before getting down to business, but in reality each of them already had a consensus about their task, and it was merely a question of getting away comfortably along to its completion. Once thatconsensuswas reached, the responsibility for it fell entirely on Trinket.","These people speak highly of themselves as ""Scent Masters"" but say all sorts of things like waiting for a Scent Master's instructions, when in fact each has his own idea already. They simply want to be told that their ideas have been approved by the Scent Master, so they will not have to take responsibility for any serious matters later on.","Theseimpsaddress themselves to their 'master' with the respectful courtesies of the Chahang tradition, muttering interjections like, 'Wait for your master's instructions,' as if all waiting for them was a dispensation from their master to go about carrying on with business. So having done their bidding, they can scarcely be blamed for passing the blame onto Trinket, and then, when he objects, putting all the blame on his shoulders."

Blossoms from the sunflower plant stood up straight in the air, over which drizzling rain fell.","The rains have destroyed countless high-corn fields, and the fields are jubilantly playing at night, the cockroaches hiding under the stalks of the corn. The foxes sit quietly in the dimly-lit caves, watching as the raindrops fall from the tall stalks of the corn. Roads soon become muddy, the grass covering the ground with patches of yellow and black, and the flowers of the zizai were standing upright, their leaves wet and limp.","Millions of sorghum stalked the field, roaring in the evening breeze as its stems tucked into the ground beneath its roots. foxes hopped under the stems to hide their white paws; sheep lay in darkness-free tunnels underneath the fields, watching as falling drops dried and shone with light from the weeds; the path soon caked in mud, bracken stood up,菊子清晰地举着头上的湿透的头。","The rain pounded down on countless tall reeds, as it danced through the fields, the frogs huddled under the tall stalks of corn, their skin gleaming with snow-white fur; the foxes crouched in a dark hole, watching the tiny droplets that fell from the tall cornstalks, soon making the road muddy, the grass bowing low, and the daisies awake with wet heads.","The rain beat against countless sorghum stalks, and the rain sang in the field; croaking frogs hid under the sorghum roots, squishing out white halterbones as though wearing哈达哈达的蓑衣。 Wolves crouched in dim corners of the field watching tiny droplets of rain splash up from the ground. The path became mudded and spongy, and weeds bent over so much that their stems were visible. Daisyweed lifted its heads, wet and glistening."
那刘老老先听见告艰苦，只当是没想头了， 又听见给他二十两银子，喜的眉开眼笑道：“我们也知道艰难的，但只俗语说的：‘瘦死的骆驼比马还大’呢。,"When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about 'difficulties' she concluded that there was no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of silver can be imagined. 'We knew you had your troubles,' she said, 'but as the saying goes, 'A starved camel is bigger than a fat horse.'","That's what Liu old man told him first. He thought he was thinking of his own thoughts; then he heard that he got twenty pieces of silver for him, and laughed happily: ""We know how hard it is, but just from what I've learned from my mother tongue 'soreness' is also a sign of suffering.""","At the time their little presence was unknown to him, but as he listened more and more they became increasingly anxious: it was as if every word he said were weighing on his soul. 'I know how hard it is,' he thought. 'But according to the saying 'fat birds are greater than horses' . .'","Tao Lao was first struck by the hardships, thinking that he had lost his mind, hearing him give him twenty gold pieces, he burst out laughing and said, ""We also know difficulties, but the saying goes, 'a skinny camel is as big as a horse'.""",At first Mo爹听到这女孩说起难处时还把她当作没有听出话来，直到Twenty唐拿出二十两银子给他说的时候，他才又惊又喜地睁开眼睛笑眯眯地说起来：「听人常说‘肥猪八两卖不穷’，如今我们二两银子也有人给，也算得是‘瘦死的骆驼比马大’吧！」,"The Teng Old Grandfather heard that his old age was hard for him, and thought it was a waste of time. Then he heard that he received twenty two baos, which made him smile happily. ""We know how difficult things are, but we have heard that the saying is: 'a horse that is thin cannot be as big as a man.'""","At a certain point on he gave in to sarcasm, understanding that by 'sacred saying' he was referring to the old book of use which says: 'To him who has many troubles in life, the devil is not far off even in size'.","Mr Liu heard that it was difficult. He thought this was just a joke. Hearing that he would receive 20 lians of silver, he burst out laughing and said: ""We also know how hard things can get, but the saying goes 'a lean camel is as big as a horse'.""","First hearing this, Grannie Liu had assumed that the same old story did not apply to them (they had yet to be informed that they were to receive a twenty-crown bonus), but upon being told that it was twenty-counsels he was to have, she had allowed her eyes to narrow up and her smile to brighten: 'How true,' she said to Bao-yu, 'that say of the fat horse and the thin camel!","That Liu's old man heard that he was hard of heart, thinking it was no big deal; but then he heard that he received twenty two shillings, with a smile on his face: ""We know how tough it is, but just from what we learned in our days, 'the fat can't be compared to a horse'.""","According to old Grannie Liu, it was a signal sign that she had been chosen by chance to suffer with them; for before her very eyes there was already enough food for two people for the whole year, and yet it turned out that one of the terms of the task was to give twenty taels of silver over to its occupant. This made her look forward with pleasant lips: 'We know how hard it is going down a slope—and I suppose everyone knows that ‘a thin rock holding a camel together will not hold a man'!","Liu was first taken aback by the hardships of his fellow workers, thinking they were just joking about it, but upon hearing that he would get 20 taels of silver, Liu burst out laughing and said with a smile, ""Of course we know how hard life is. We also say 'the skinny camel is as big as a horse'.""","Tough times don't make such a big fuss! ' said Grannie Liu, smiling from ear to ear when she received his promise of twenty taels of silver."

轿夫们停住，呆呆地看着劈腿横在路当中的劫路人。 那人身材不高，脸上涂着黑墨，头戴一顶高粱篾片编成的斗笠，身披一件大蓑衣，蓑衣敞着，露出密扣黑衣和拦腰扎着的宽腰带。 腰里别着一件用红绸布包起的鼓鼓囊囊的东西。,"The bearers stopped in their tracks and stared dumbstruck at the highwayman of medium height who stood in the road, his legs akimbo.

它原先是一片蛮荒地，荆榛苇茅丛生，狐狸野兔的乐园，后来有了几架牧人的草棚，后来逃来了杀人命犯、落魄酒徒、亡命赌棍…… 他们建造房屋，开垦荒地，拓扑出人的乐园，狐狸野兔迁徙他乡，临别时齐声发出控诉人类的鸣叫。,"At one time the site had been a wasteland covered with brambles, underbrush, and reeds, a paradise for foxes and wild rabbits. Then a few huts appeared, and it became a haven for escaped murderers, drunks, gamblers, who built homes, cultivated the land, and turned it into a paradise for humans, forcing out the foxes and wild rabbits, who set up howls of protest on the eve of their departure.","The land was once a place of wilderness, where thorns and moss covered the ground, where foxes and rabbits roamed, and there were some wooden huts for the shepherd's wives to live in. But over time, they built a few houses, then came up with a few more, and then a few more, until they had all left their mark on people's lives. The foxes and rabbits migrated from one place to another, each calling out a cry of human distress.","Before then the place was nothing but ditches, willows, and foxes, herons, and weasels. Some monks had built cottages. Then traffic had come from farmers' huts, and lastly ruthless gamblers and thieves had run away, promising a place of death for anyone who crossed their path. The deer and foxes had fled to other parts, calling out curse words as they flew toward the destructed houses and turned back to see their human hosts.","It was once a wild land of thorns, willows, and reeds, home to foxes and rabbits. But after that came several tents for farmers, then some fugitives from crime, outcasts from drinking, and gamblers who had run away from their lives… They built houses and cultivated the land, creating human gardens where foxes and rabbits migrated, and as they left, they all cried out against humanity.","A desolate wilderness once covered with bushes, sorghum, and reeds, it was home to foxes and rabbits until a few scattered huts were built by farmers and cultivated by settlers. Gloomy messages were emitted when the human inhabitants fled the land of their dreams.","It was once a barren place, where thorns and grass grew, and the denizens of the woods lived happily. Then came a few houses of farmers, who built meadows and cleared land. They then built homes for themselves, while the foxes and rabbits migrated to other parts of the world, and their voices could be heard as they made their last journey together.","Before, it was a deserted place, cluttered with wild vegetation long enough for foxes and herons to live, or poor drunkards to flee; later they came sheep and snakes settling in their sheds, wandering across the land as they built houses, screeching at humans as they planted crops, tortoises and crabs moving abroad as they called out their agony.","It was once a wild place, filled with thorns, reeds, and foxes and rabbits, until the arrival of a few herders' huts, then came out killers, vagabonds, and gamblers… They built houses, cleared land, and made human paradise. The foxes and rabbits moved away, leaving behind their cries of complaint at man's destruction.","A desolate area, home to wild foxes and rabbits, it had once hosted a few scattered adobe houses built by ranchers who, having fallen on hard times, had then drawn upon it as a den for delinquent gamblers and desperate murderers.","It was once a desolate place where thorns and grass grew wild, where foxes and rabbits played their favorite spots, and later came the presence of farmers’ huts.

我先孝敬了母亲，赶着就给你们老太太、姨母送了些去。 如今留了些，我要自己吃恐怕折福，左思右想除我之外惟你还配吃。,"I've given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I've still got a lot left over. I can't eat it all myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is worthy to eat a present like this is you.","I first gave my mother respect and then I brought some for her, so I have left a little for you. I am afraid that I will eat it myself if I don't eat it right away, so I wonder who is still left to me, and what should be eaten by others besides me.","I took the time to attend her mother's funeral,' I told you, 'and brought a bit or two back with me.

It'll be some from one or two other gentlemen who serve at your太太's wedding if we haven't any left.",I first treated my mother well before sending some gifts to your aunt and grandmother. Now I have kept a few for myself as I think it would be a loss of merit to eat them. All other people are not suitable except you.,"I offered first as yet nothing was due to my mother; then went to give some to Lady Wang and my Auntian. What remained I kept for myself; but since eating it would involve me in sin, I engaged my thoughts on how to distribute it so as not to offend Heaven. Finally I decided that since it was for my own benefit only that I chose not to take any of it, I should give it to old Lady Wang's husband.","Firstly I took care of my mother, and then we delivered some to you. Now, I have left a lot; I am afraid that it will be a curse to me if I don’t eat them myself. Left to my own devices, I would certainly not eat them.","I gave her a little for her birthday and am sending some to Her Ladyship's as well. I've got a good deal left for myself now; but right now I can't see what's the point in keeping them, so I'm thinking: What's the same kind of trouble would I pose for You if I ate them all?","I first took care of my mother, then sent some for your grandmother and aunt. Now I have kept a few, for I do not want to deprive myself of eating them. I think that no one else is fit for eating them except you.","I first had to show my mother some consideration; then, as a matter of generosity, I gave a little to your ladyship and your amah. Nowadays I have left enough to myself; but I have to think whether I shan't be able to claim my share. In doing this I have finally come to the conclusion that except you there is nobody else who is entitled to it.","First I showed respect for my mother, and then we sent some of this to you. Right now we have a little left, so I am afraid it will be a curse to me. After thinking about it, I wonder whether there is anyone who would still be able to eat after I leave this world.","I gave our mother a place of residence first. As I was on my way to see Her Old Ladyship and her sister-in-law, to make sure you had everything you needed, I sent them off with some of the flour I had left over from my own diet. Now they've got plenty themselves, and I can't come near them for fear of disappointment. So it's decided I will now take the risk of eating you myself.","I first showed respect for my mother, then sent some food to your grandmother and aunt. I now have a little left over, so that I can eat it myself, which would be detrimental to my reputation. I am thinking of you first because no one else is worthy enough to eat this.","I offered some of it as a gift to your mother; this you ought to understand was done with utmost modesty. I thought it right first to satisfy her wishes; but having now satisfied her, I thought it was due to you to give you some also. What I left over I wanted for myself—but on the other hand I think if I吃了对不住算我多吃，叫你空欢喜；所以最后我还是拿去给你了。"

Even though there was some noise, it was drowned out by the laughter.","He let out a loud laughing fit, but his right leg gave way before he was done throwing the dagger from his hip and drawing it from his sheath.

Even if there was some faint noise, it would be covered by the laughter.","He began laughing loudly, his body starting in a series of jerks and twitches; then, very slowly, he placed the point of the dagger in his grip, and though making no sound, drew it free of the sheath.","Silent laughter echoed through the room, and the body moved with great force as he leered at the wall. He was already grabbing the blade's handle from his bag and pulling it out slowly. The sound of his laughter was not heard except for a small amount of noise; he wanted to hide the sound away.""","He let out a great cry of delight while his body went freefalling left right.

这是深入肌肤，已经谈不上是亲是近，反有些起腻，暗底里生畏的，却是有一股噬骨的感动。,"This is a feeling that, having penetrated the flesh, goes beyond closeness. One begins to weary of it. It breeds a secret fear, but hidden within that fear is an excitement that gnaws down to the bone.","This is skin deep, not flesh close or near. It's a little off, but it's a very intense feeling of biting. It's lurking inside, but there's a strong feeling of gnawing.","It is deeper than the skin on your body, though it might not have been the deepest and the neatest of a place; a place you still feel repulsive even when it is never near. The feeling that grips you holds you back even when you have nothing at all to hold it against.","This is skin-deep, not so much close as it is intimate, but it's a bit repulsive, a kind of fear that has built up in my heart, and yet there's this burning sense of emotion.","This intimacy is not merely reciprocal; it is corrosive, instilling in you a fear of depth but also prompting a response, perhaps the most surprising.","This is flesh that has not yet been considered dear or near, but there is a certain heat that makes one shudder inwardly. But there is a deep, terrifying feeling that animates it.","It is deep into the skin and has no longer the connotations of affection or nearness, though at times one feels an instinctive repulsion; but beneath this disgust there is a biting feeling that binds you more紧密。","This is a skin-deep affection that is neither close nor intimate; instead it has a sort of repulsive attraction, but there's also a kind of profound feeling of love for her.","This proximity makes you feel both very close and very distant; at first you get a crush, then fear. But there is an overwhelming surge of emotional attraction.","This is a deeply touching skin, it doesn't seem to be close or intimate; but there's something that's quite repellent. The dark corners of my heart start to tremble with fear, yet there's a stirring sensation in the pit of his stomach that seems to have swallowed him whole.","It is deep into the skin and already much less an 'are you closer' question than a 'do I like you' one. The flesh is no longer warm against one's body, but there is a biting sense of噬骨的满足。",This is so intimate that it's not a close relationship anymore; it's something that makes you feel uncomfortable and unattractive. But there's this overwhelming feeling of being deeply moved by it.,This bond goes deeper than simply parentesis; it becomes a fearfully attractive obsession.

Madam and Mrs. Liu had hidden secrets that they hardly ever mentioned, and no one knew what behind them; yet they did not know each other's hearts and souls and could not build up a solid foundation before offering a怜惜的眼光。","As half-way friends, they each have their own secrets, like Lady Yin who poured out her chest as if pouring out a jar of beans – there might be some things she did not know herself, but we do not need to know everything about them; just that little bit of sympathy would suffice.","A friend who does not know you all the way has different constraints than she does with regular friends. Even if Madame Yan is willing to go on delivering seeds, there are things she may not want to reveal. It's a matter of trust. They are glad for her simple kindness, but try to act as if they are on equal terms.","Halfway through their friendship, they have different hidden inclinations. While I admire your strict mother, there’s also something she may not know that you don’t either. We can share some empathy and understand each other better.",Wang Qiyao's friends were all different enough to keep her going; even those who drove by didn't know what she was going through and had no way of knowing the depth of her hidden feelings. A little kindness would go a long way to keeping her going.,"Those who are friends halfway on their way, each with their own secrets, like Madame Cang of Guan. She does not know what is hidden inside her own chest, but she can understand that others do not know it either. If they can show some understanding, then they will be happy enough.","If they were to claim each other as friends, they would have to make some sacrifices. It was true that Madame Yan spilt beans like a dripping bamboo barrel, but there must be things she did not know about her friend that she did not share; none of them placed themselves entirely in their friend's shoes, and all they wanted in return for their devotion was a bit of understanding and sympathy.","Like friends who meet halfway on the way, each with their own hidden inclinations, I don’t mean to say that Uncle Li is a fool for putting up such a joke; there may be something we didn’t know that he doesn’t know either. And I can understand them if they can share some compassion with us.","People like Wang Qiyao and her friends who came and visited could hardly be described as unaccommodable; each of them had hidden secrets that they chose not to discuss with others, and which might have some unexpected relevance to the conversation. To show some sympathy, but not to take advantage of their being interested in old tales, one should try to guess as much as possible from what was being told.","As friends who meet halfway, each has their own secrets, don’t look at how Madame Dong junks her bamboo tubes like beans, there may be some secrets that she does not know herself either, so we do not need to know each other’s inside and out, just a little understanding can be enough.","Because they had made no journey together, each woman was at liberty to keep her secrets; but who would have thought that Madame Yan, with her full mouth, had any reservations about? It transpired that she had kept them back for herself; but as long as she felt your sympathy, that was all right with her."
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”,"Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'",Qian Xiaobang wanted him to know what a Heaven Pavilion穴和环跳穴是什么意思，怎样用功法来点穴和解穴，但转过头来看，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴都不会，难道会让下属们看轻他？反正对付一个小姑娘的事情也不是很难，点头应道：“知道了。”,"I don't know about that secret word you're talking about, Brother,' Trinket was about to asking them what it meant, 'but I do know that it's where a man puts his thumb against whose aim to cause pain and then removes it again as soon as he wants it to stop. It's also the same thing you did when we put our fingers on your target—to give or remove pain as quickly as we want.'","Wu Xiaoliao wanted to ask him what was a ""temple"" point and an ""arrowhead point"", how to do acupuncture and acupressure, but he thought better of it. He was the head disciple of the main hall and the chief of the grotto, so he couldn't even do acupuncture and acupressure. Isn't that embarrassing? Anyway, dealing with a young girl isn't difficult at all. Wu Xiaoliao nodded his head and said, ""I understand.""","He was thinking of asking the questions that involved names of acupoints and how to stimulate them and how to find the same acupoints after one had been stimulated, but he decided it would be enough for him to be a Taoist副主子和舵主的弟子, even though he didn't know what acupoints were, to be looked down on by his subordinates, when he could do nothing of the sort. He settled for a simple 'yes' instead.","Zhu Zai Ba wants to know what a heaven's temple穴和环跳穴是什么，怎样点穴解穴，但是转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴解穴都不会，难道会让下属们看不起吗？反正对付一个小姑娘也不是什么困难的事情，点头应答：""知道啦。""","I've no idea what those terms are; I don't know how to use it except to pick a number. I haven't ever done anything like this before myself. So it must be really hard for someone like Brother Wei to find out what a神堂穴是什么意思, or how to do it, or—what matters most—and even getting him to解开我的穴具也不容易。 It's hardly a problem I can solve myself.'","Wu Xiaogang wanted to ask him what he meant by ""sacred hall points"" and ""ring point"". How did he use them? But then he thought of his position as the head monk of the Yellow Wood Hall and his master's disciple, and even if he couldn't use them himself, he didn't want his subordinates to think that he was too incompetent. In the end, it would be fine for a little girl. He nodded and said, ""I understand.""","Trinket was about to ask what the Godit was for and where they got their name 'Ringit' from and whether they were supposed to be able to needle and unneedle them—and all the other things that go with it—but he realised that asking these questions would involve giving the girl one of his greater superiors whom he did not know very well a handout, so he changed his mind and took the girl at her word. 'All right, I've heard,' he said.","Zhu Xiaobang wanted to know what a heaven temple point is, how to point it out, and what to do with it, but when he thought about it, he was a member of the Qingming Temple's headmaster, and his chief secretary was also a student who had been under his tutelage. He could not even point or solve for it, would that really make them all look down on him?"" No problem! I will now tell you.","I get what 'godfather' is supposed to be for a king; but what're these called in the Mermaids Lodge when you perform them?' he wondered to himself as his pride was about tumbledown. 'If I'd been sent off to treat her with godfatheric, she wouldn't have been any less useless than anyone else. All I've ever done is performed our Hard Headed Brother Li's magic tricks. I'm no match for a little girl.'","Wu Xiaogang wanted to ask him what a god temple meridian and a ring point were, how to press points and relieve points, but after thinking about it, he was a disciple of the headmaster of the Green Wood Hall, so he didn’t even know how to press points and relieve points, wouldn’t it be too embarrassing for his subordinates? Anyway, dealing with a little girl wasn’t difficult at all, so he nodded and said, “I’ve heard.”","Trinket was about asking the questions that had been on his mind—the meaning of the Holy Hall and Touch-shoulders and Hip-Pocket, how to press and hold and release them, 'and how to find out whether they were working—' but he decided it would be going too far to ask the girl who spoke with such obvious ease and confidence about such serious matters. 'I get it,' he said, feeling reasonably sure that she understood completely."

Then it occurred to her that if she was going to argue with the boy, she might as well let him see her. 'Yes, go ahead,' she said curtly to him. 'Now you've got to draw these patterns.'

父亲，一九五七年，你躲在我家里间屋里那个地洞里时，你每日每夜，在永恒的黑暗中，追忆流水年月，你至少三百六十次想到了我们家那几十间房屋的屋盖在大火中塌落的情景。 你想到你的父亲我的爷爷在那时刻想到了什么，我的幻想紧追着你的幻想，你的幻想紧追着爷爷的思维。,"Father, when you were hiding in the burrow we dug for you in the floor of my home back in 1957, you recalled those days of your past in the unrelenting darkness. On no fewer than 365 occasions, in your mind you saw the roof of your house crash down amid the flames, and wondered what was going through the mind of your father, my granddad. So my fantasies were chasing yours while yours were chasing Granddad's.","Father, in 1957, when you hid me in my home's attic that night, I kept remembering the scenes of the fire from our house's thirty rooms every day. I thought about what my father my grandfather thought about the situation at that time. My imagination followed your imagination, and your imagination followed his thoughts.","In 1957, when you hid yourself in my house during that dead-end dark of the city, you spent every day, every night, retracing the progress of the years that had fallen into the fire. You've dreamed that your father Mr Li didn't think about how our houses had collapsed due to the大火. You have continued to think about his thought until it was finally realized by your grandfather.","Father, in September of 1957, you were hiding in my mother's room cellar, where you spent every night in eternal darkness recalling our family's houses that had been destroyed by fire. You dreamed about what your father, my grandfather, was thinking at that moment, while my imagination followed yours, and then your imagination followed mine.","In 1957, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you hid in one of the tunnels in my house. Every night you, Father, traced your thoughts back to the thousands of rooms in our estate that had burned to the ground during the uprising. How many times did you think, Father? I chased your thoughts, and they chased Granddad's mind.","Father, in 1957, when you were hiding under my bed in that little room, I was thinking of the house in which we lived from the beginning of time until the present day. Every night I would dream about what happened in the fires at our place of residence. I thought about your father's grandfather, who had also been thinking about it, but he did not think about us either.","Your home was hidden beneath the couch in that room underneath the house where you hid for three years, and every day, three times a day, you focused on the scene of the collapse of the roof of those dozen or so houses in the face of the fire. You focused on your father Mr. Anshu when he realized what had happened to our houses. Your imagination followed his thought; his thought followed his grandfather's imagination.","Father, when you hid in my house under a hole last July of 1957, you recalled our family's houses falling apart every night in the eternal darkness. Your thoughts were at least three hundred sixty times about what your father, my grandfather, was thinking in that moment. My imagination followed yours as you followed your grandfather's mind.","In 1957, during the time you hid in one of the cellars in my house, you, on forever, counted back the days since the water had flowed freely; you thought hundreds of times, 'Now, what did that father of yours remember, as he crouched in that hole we dug for you?'"" Your body raced forward while your mind chased after Granddad's thoughts.","The father, in 1957, when I was hiding in a cave at your house between the rooms, you kept thinking about our house, which had been destroyed by fire that year, hundreds of times. You thought about what my grandfather must have thought as he watched the burning of the house, and I followed his thoughts closely.","In 1956, when you hid yourself in my home at that time that October, each night you buried yourself in your darkness, you recited the names of the houses lost in the fire every year. You used this memory to convince your father, my grandfather, that the roof of our house had collapsed. You used his memory as a cue behind his thought.","Father, you were hiding in a hole in my house every night during the year 1957, when you would at least think of the scene of our houses being destroyed by fire every single day, while you were thinking about your own father, my grandfather, who was thinking about what he thought about that moment.

这情景持续了很长时间后，她在朦胧中想到，这可能就是她永恒的归宿了，这就是她的地狱，三个太阳构成的地狱之火将永远灼烧着她，这是她因那个超级背叛受到的惩罚。,"This state lasted for some time, and she hazily thought it was probably the end for her. It was her hell. The fire of the three suns would torment her and burn her forever. This was punishment for her betrayal, the betrayal that exceeded all others.","The scene continued for a long time after which she realized that this was her eternal destination; it was the hell, the three suns forming the hell of hell itself burning its fire on her forever, this being the punishment for her having committed the super treason.","After a long time, she could smell the scent of death drifting through the village. Three suns were capable of burning hot within her heart, and that was the punishment for her betrayal.","After a long time, she drifted back into consciousness, thinking that this might be her eternal home.

For a while she even believed that her hell would be the three suns of地狱所形成的地狱之火, which would burn away her soul and forever numb the memory of her superhuman betrayal.","This scene lasted for a long time before she realized that it may be her eternal destination, her hell, where three suns burn forever, punishing her for the super betrayal.","The scene lasted for a long time.

And three suns—her super背叛就是这个太阳组成的地狱之火,将会毒害她,永不停息地灼烧她,这是她因超脱伟大而承受的惩罚。","This scene lasted for a long time before she drifted back to her original thought: this might be where she would forever rest, this is her hell, three suns burning on her as they will burn forever, that is her punishment for being betrayed by the super villain.","The scene continued for a while, and suddenly she became fuzzy-eyed that she might say that those were the coordinates of her eternal home—that was the three suns' burning fire, which would burn her forever.

下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。,"Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.","In the afternoon, when it is time for injections, there is often a gap of about 30 minutes between two injections. This is all empty, just her and I, sitting side by side. The summer has not yet fully gone, and she can’t help but groggy. Summer evenings have left us exhausted, and she cannot help but groggy. She has not quite recovered from the morning nap, which still hasn’t completely passed. It is impossible to tell what was said during the night.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early in the three o'clock time frame. While the hour was empty, a hour or two left free, the girls would stand idly by with their arms encrossled over their heads. Summer illness had yet to work its way away, and they caught odd glances from deadchairs桐树上的蝉吱吱地鸣叫着。 Nobody knew what to say.","They came for shots around 4 or so in the afternoon. This hour was always empty. It was just them two, sitting face to face. The summer sleep had not fully passed, they could not help yawning all the time. They tried to stay awake, but they did not know what they were saying. The cicadas on the branches of a crape myrtle kept calling, it sounded like ""wha-wha-who"".","They usually came in at three or four in the afternoon, leaving the studio empty for them two women, face to face. At that hour, with the困倦刚刚过去的午睡效应, they would begin to feel sleepy, and would yawn, over and over. They tried hard to keep their eyes open, but the cicadas from the walnut tree outside seemed unable to restrain themselves and continued to chirp, their voices growing louder as they moved up the stem of the tree.","In the afternoon, they came for injections at 3 o'clock, but this hour was empty. They were both alone, sitting side by side. The sun's midday nap had not yet completely taken hold, and she couldn't help groggy with a thud. In summer, the night-time sleep hadn’t quite finished. She couldn’t stop coughing and sneezing.","In the afternoon they gave the shots early, around three. The hour was empty, until Tao Wang and Tian Qi's voicephone began calling. Sun Lipt out of her own self-control and threw herself onto the wheel, harrying the scoldings from nowhere until she knew everything she could think of would make them want to wake up.","They came for shots around 4 PM, a time when they were left alone all afternoon. They sat together, with their faces facing each other. It was still too early for them to catch up on sleep after lunchtime naps. They kept yawning. They tried hard not to fall asleep but failed. The sound of crickets chirping from a tree above them reached them through the window, sounding like a constant buzz, and it was impossible to tell if what they heard was real or just a trick of the wind.","They usually来了打针的时间是三点半左右,这一小时里却空荡荡的，只有她们两个人，在一棵梧桐树下面对面坐着。那时天还有点亮，但困意已经开始上身，不时有打哈欠的声音传来，此处便嘈嘈杂杂的，语无伦次。","In the afternoon, when we should have a shot at 3:00 PM, there was always one left open, and they were both sitting alone. Summer’s evening nap had not yet fully passed, and she couldn’t help but groan. She struggled with her thoughts as if she was on a drugstore drug store. She didn’t know what she was saying.","The late afternoon appointments were usually around 3 pm, when the hour-long consult was empty. It was then that Nannie and Auntie Wang struck up a conversation—a brief snooze still awake from their morning naps, but completely blank on everything else. Their energy would not last until they had already heard the silvery sparrows scallinggle away singing overhead, who sang with the utmost clarity as soon as they arrived.","They came to get their shots around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. This hour was always wasted, and they were the two of them sitting face-to-face. The summer nap had not completely passed yet, so she couldn't help yawning again and again. They managed to keep their spirits up, but what they said was unclear even to themselves. The crickets chirped from a cypress tree outside, sounding like a continuous series of whirring sounds.","They came in for shots around three o'clock in the afternoon, and since it was an hour off the normal schedule, they sat face to face, one woman on each side. During those hours, when the sleep of the evening had not yet slipped completely away but the mind was still alert enough to keep them awake, they would indulge in long stretches of napping, during which the cicadas howled without a care in the world."

周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!","The man who heard this said that he had guessed a few things from what was said. Because of his father-in-law's ability to buy land from him many times, now seeing how much his old father-in-law has bought, he felt quite pleased with his own thoughts; also, he wanted to show off his own dignity. He laughed and said, ""Old old you are so free!","By this she could almost tell what the old lady had in view. It was because, during one of his last fights with the village丈人, Grannie Liu had secured a field by means of climbing over their heads, Trinket had needed to raise such strength; and that Grannie Lui had succeeded in forcing them all out, but having made good their损失， so that they could and would like to congratulate each other on their brave deed. Sarcasm being available for play, she gave the寡妇一个承诺，她说：老老你放心，我绝没有向外边去找的意思。","Wang Ru’s ears perked up when she heard this. She knew that the old man wanted to buy a piece of land, but he had received help from her husband’s father in the past. Hearing that the old man was now willing to do so, Wang Ru felt no difficulty about it. Furthermore, she also wanted to show off her dignity. She said with a smile, ""Old man, rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife immediately guessed that her visit was connected with the quarrel about the fields, which she had heard so much about; but she realized presently that it was a more complicated business than this, because the old woman's father had been involved in the transaction; and having now seen her in person, she was gratified at being able to satisfy him her sincerity in coming. 'Old colour, I say! You can rely on us!","Zhou Ru's father heard that he was right. He had guessed what she meant by her words."" Because he knew his husband had once been involved in a land dispute with his father, which gave him a considerable advantage over his mother-in-law. It made him feel uneasy because of the fact that his own body was being displayed. He laughed and said, ""Old old you can be yourself. ""","By this time Trinket had almost everything he needed to understand a word of what she said. Firstly it was already apparent from his earlier remarks that Old Gu’s wife was trying to persuade him to do something about a matter which had troubled him for some time. She wanted to know whether it was possible to gain land by fighting its way out of certain difficulties; and also, as he could plainly see from the old man’s conversation that he had been thinking it over on his own, to demonstrate his good grumblings, he added with a little glee: 'You go figure, Oldgeorge! You can go away with a Big Dipper!'","Jiuzhe has already guessed what is going on. He knows that his wife's husband bought some land a few years ago with the help of his father-in-law. Now he sees Liu Langlan so well, he can't resist him. Secondly, he also wants to show off his face. So he said, ""Old old, you don't need to worry.""",Zhou Rui's wife guessed at part of their purpose; but it was with a sense of personal embarrassment that she deferred to Mr Gou-er's judgment as a means of avoiding any appearance of improper advantage.,"The Zhou Ran family was already guessing what his wife had meant when she heard this. For he knew that his father had always been there for him, even though he had just won a battle with Liu old man. He laughed and said, ""Old old you have your own mind.","By now both Zha Rui's wife and her husband都应该知道了, what he said was the sort of thing that would impress his husband, who had recently experienced the astonishing feat of uniting the resources of a hundred brothers to buy up a field. He put the matter down as best he could, for the only thing that counts is showing off one's worth, and being assuredly taking the bait: 'Of course not, Grannie!","Wang Rui’s ears perked up at hearing this. He knew what was afoot as he remembered that his father-in-law had helped his husband get land before. Seeing how old man Liu looked today, Wang Rui could not help himself. He said with a smile: ""Old old, you can rest assured.""","Zhou Rui's wife guessed at part of his intention immediately; but it was with a mixture of jealousy and self-aggrandisement that she received her visitor. 'Don't worry, old dear!' she said with a gracious smile. 'I'll make sure that you have something to eat and to drink today."

It’s also not in line with the regulations.","He had wanted to go down to the market, but he must not have been aware that they would let us stay for a while so that someone else could come in to look after us, since there were other rules about staying overnight.","He wants to go out for a walk too, but we have not been sent back yet. We can't be left here without supervision, which is against the rules.","He also wanted to go out on the street, but didn't get past the screen.

He doesn't fit with what is expected of us.","He had wanted to ride the streets all day long, but by the time they finally let us go back home without our money, it looked like someone would have been arranged to pick up our goods anyway.","He also wants to go on the street, but he doesn’t want us to be left here without supervision until we’re released, which is against the rules.","He also wanted to go to the market that day, but before our release time came, they kept us here without someone to look after us, which wasn't in line with our conditions."

只见桌上仍是放着许多碟点心，他取了几块吃了，听得靴子声响，只怕来的不是小玄子，心想先钻入桌底再说，却听得小玄子在门外叫道：“小桂子，小桂子！”,"The table was piled high again with good things to eat, and this time Trinket tucked in with a vengeance. Then he heard the flip-ploy of cloth boots again. He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty. 'Laurel! Laurel!' It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway.","Only what he was doing is just standing there with a lot of food on the table; he took some pieces, and heard the footsteps coming from the floor, but it seemed that he wasn't coming from Little Quanxiang. He thought first of entering the table below before talking about it, but then he heard Little Quanxiang say, ""Little Chuanshan, Little Chuanshan!""""","A voice asked from under the table, 'Crimson child from before!'

He thought it might not be Xiao Quanzi, so he wanted to go down into the table first. He heard Xiao Quanzi calling from outside, ""Small Guo Jie, Small Guo Jie!""","Still lying on the table were a number of plates full of various cakes and sweets. As he was eating, Taiyuan heard the sound of boots approaching. He hoped it wasn't Misty, but realized that if it were, cricking his knees under the table might be out of the question. 'Ki-cui-ki!' cried Misty calling out for him.","Only the table remained empty, and he took a few pieces of bread, which he ate. He wondered what was wrong with the person coming in, thinking that he would first enter the table and then ask him some questions.

He thought that it might be someone who came in from outside, so he decided to enter the table and asked him some questions.","As he did not have anything to eat, he took a few before taking another one out when someone suddenly appeared at the doorway with a big grin on his face.

这剪尖其实甚钝，小郡主肌肤虽嫩，却也没伤到她丝毫，可是她惊惶之下，只道这小恶人真的用刀子在自己脸上雕花，一阵气急，便晕了过去。,"Although she had the most delicate complexion imaginable, the point was so blunt that it made not the slightest mark on her skin; but so great was her fear, that she imagined this horrible boy really was cutting patterns on her face and, from excess of emotion, she fainted clean away.","The tip of the blade is rather sharp, but when Minyoung was frightened, she did not hurt her at all. But she was so startled that she thought this small villain had actually cut her face with a knife. She was too shocked to be able to fall unconscious.","The clasp point was quite blunt, and so even a little girl who wasn't very strong had already suffered enough from being prying open like that. But suddenly all too soon this Little Trinket's mind was on another thing. She had been expecting some图案， but as she was unable to see through the paper, she had believed that the boy was merely trying to etch a design on her face—quite obviously he hadn't—the effect of which would be completely unnoticed—and had collapsed at the sight.","The blade was actually very blunt; the little princess's skin was so delicate that it hadn't even hurt her at all. However, she was frightened and thought that this small villain had really carved flowers on her face with a knife. She became furious and fainted after that.","The sharpness of the scissors, however, proved insufficient to cause any serious injury. Still, frightened and helpless, she followed what she thought must be the boy's threat with her eyes, and fainted when he struck her across the face with what she took to be a knife.","This sharp point is indeed dull, and the little lady was so young that she had no injury to her face, but she was alarmed when she saw this small villain actually carved a mark on her face with a knife.","The razor-thin blades were sufficiently sharp that it was barely necessary for the Little Countess to notice their presence; but all too soon they realized with horror that this strange monster in charge of them was not capable of cutting flowers into their faces: he simply raised the blade, flung it across the room, and fell dead on the floor with a shock.","The blade was rather blunt, and the little princess' skin was soft yet not injured at all.

此方人家俱用竹篱木壁，也是劫数应当如此，于是接二连三牵五挂四，将一条街烧得如火焰山一般；彼时虽有军民来救，那火已成了势了，如何救得下? 直烧了一夜方息，也不知烧了多少人家。,"And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process.","This house was used for bamboo walls and is fittingly so, thus causing a curse. It then attached two and disconnected four on a single wall, burning up the street like a fireball; while there were people coming to help, the flames had already turned into something that could be extinguished. How can we save them? The fire has been burnt all night, but I don't know how many houses have been burned.","Now,' said the author, 'we would have a bamboo wall within a bamboo wall and a wooden post enclosure within a wooden post – exactly as it ought. So, if we looked down on no one, we were sure to succeed in throwing a large number of houses into flames. Even though the troops and crews from both civilian and military quarters came to assist us, the fire was already in its own master – and how could we hope to extinguish it? We burnt for three nights in vain – but now, after we had finished, we found that we had thrown away more than fifty0 families.","This family is all made of bamboo fences and wooden walls. This is a fate that should be so, so the fire continues to spread. At this time, even if the military and civilians come to help, the fire has become too strong. How could they save it? It burned all night long before it finally died down. They do not know how many houses were burnt during this period of time.","That side of the village was all enclosed by palissades of bamboo and some sort of palisading material that resembled willows rather than stones; counting them all together, it is not surprising that a place where such material burns so fiercely should quickly be extinguished, thanks to the assistance of military and common folk. When the smoke from this blaze died out after yet another day's奋战, it is hard to imagine how many houses had been burned already.","This is a household furniture made of bamboo walls and walls, as well as that is fitting for this, so when we receive two and then multiply by three and four, it will burn down to a fire mountain; however, while there were civilians who came to help, the fire had already turned into a force, how could they save it off? It burned until the night, but did not know how many houses had been burnt.","The house had inside a bamboo wall and a wooden post at the top of the wall, which caused all concerned to set about suicide, and so by the evening they had burnt down nearly as many buildings as they had been scheduled to build; however, since there was no military or naval crew to save them, they had simply blown out the flames themselves and set about burning every building in sight that they saw. By the time the night had ended, they had burnt off more than twice as many as they'd been scheduled to build. The result was that most of those buildings gone, except for those who had first planned them out on military ships or aircraft.
","This family used bamboo fences and wood walls. This is their fate. So they started burning houses one after another. Soon, they were able to burn a street like a fire mountain. At that time, even if there had been soldiers and civilians coming to help, the fire was already too large for them to stop. They burned all night long until it finally stopped. They don’t know how many houses they burnt.","Since we know that it takes a grove of palmbears and a hedge of willows to build a house, it is no wonder that there should be so many fires, with houses alight, and not to stop until at last the land was burned and everything in it was reduced to cinders.","This is how one's belongings were used as a bamboo wall, and also this is a fate that must be like this. So I received two and then placed them on five and put them on four. The street was completely burning up with fire; how could we get down? When there were military and civilians came to help, it had already become dangerous. How can we save this? Only burnt half of the house.","As you can see,' he went on, 'it's adapted so perfectly to the course of events that it seems inevitable that every person or thing connected with one of those arcs should have its house burnt on that side, so that the other arcs may burn up in smoke. In the end they will have made a total of several hundred fires, many of which were connected with one of the arcs; but though this has resulted in their objective destruction, there are still numerous buildings left standing upon the other sides of the city; and although the number of them might have been as few as a dozen, others have大火烧成好几个大院子。","This family used bamboo fences and wooden walls. This is how things should be, so they kept burning one house after another down the street, turning it into a fire mountain. While there were soldiers and civilians trying to put out the fire, the fire had already become too big to put out. They burned all night long before it finally died down. How many houses did they burn down that night?","Since these houses were all built of willow hedge and thatch, it was the hand of Heaven that decided how many of them should go up. Straight away a strip of burnt ash stretched from one end of the village to the other. By the time the soldiers and folk arrived on the scene, the fire had become so gigantic that nothing could be done to save the homes within. By the end of the night of burning there must have been a great many homes left in ruins, not know what number there were, if any at all."

“审判日”号宽阔的甲板上很空荡，只是后甲板上有一个人在用水龙头冲洗缆桩，汪淼从高处看得很清楚，当船的这一部分从钢柱间移过的瞬间，那人的身体突然僵硬了，水龙头从他手里滑落；与此同时，连接龙头的胶皮水带也在不远处断成两截，水从那里白花花地喷了出来，那人直直地站了几秒钟就倒下了，他的身体在接触甲板的同时分成两截。,"Judgment Day's wide deck was empty save for one man standing near the stern hosing down the ship's bollards. From his vantage point, Wang saw everything clearly. The moment that that section of the ship passed between the pillars, the hose broke into two pieces not too far from the man, and water spilled out. The man's body stiffened, and the nozzle tumbled from his hand. He remained standing for a few seconds, then fell. As his body contacted the deck, it came apart in two halves.","The large deck on which the ship was anchored was empty except for a man sitting by a hosepipe cleaning缆桩。Ming Yu could see clearly from above as the ship's section passed over the steel pillar, and he noticed that his body had suddenly stiffened when the person beside him started to wash the cable桩。As the part of the ship moved under the bridge, the water hose slipped from his hand; at the same time, the plastic pipe water hoses were severed in front of him, and the water sprayed out like liquid rain.

He stood up straight and fell down with the structure of his body divided into two parts.","Judgment Day was empty except for the person above board, who sat and stewed out on the rear deck cleaning the pylons with a flowing water head. Wang could make out his name through the dust under him as the ship's part of it shifted forward, and when the man fell, his waterhead sailed down like the back of a tack.

The man stood still for several seconds before he fell down, his body splitting in two parts when he touched the deck.","Judgment Day was empty except for the person on the rear deck cleaning the pylon with a flow of running water. As the ship began to move over the piers, Wang could make out the motion; the person froze as the water ran down, then, as he broke the connection between the stem and the rubber paddle chain, white spray spread across it. Another split occurred right next to the ship's hull as people stood above it. They stood up straight,切成两半。","Day of Judgment,"" the broad deck was empty except for a man washing anchor points from the high vantage point. Hu Man’s clear view made him see that the person’s body stiffened when the ship passed by this part of the vessel, his water faucet falling off as he reached out to touch it.

The man straightened up for a few seconds before collapsing, his body splitting in two at the instant of contact with the deck.","There was a lot of empty space on the broad deck of Judgment, except for one person who was washing the mooring hooks with the water faucet on the aft deck. Wang looked down from a height to see the man's body jerk to a stop as the ship passed over him just as the steel pillars were visible. The faucet fell out of his hand, and white water sprayed up whiteward from where his body had stood on the deck for a few seconds until it had been split in two by the断裂的水带. His body then collapsed onto the deck, his limbs splitting open slowly as they hit the ground.","The broad deck on which the ship was anchored was empty except for a person washing the cable桩手扶着龙头冲洗， Ma Xiaoming could see clearly from a high place as the ship's part moved through the pillar span.

As the ship moved across the bridge, Wang could make out the person's sudden motion of stiffening his body.

His body split into two as he flew through the air.","The wide deck of the ""Judgment Day"" was empty except for one person washing the mooring cleats with a water tap from high above.

韦小宝道：“不降！” 欲待挺腰翻起，蓦地里腰间一阵酸麻，后腰两处穴道已被小玄子屈指抵住，那正是海老公昨晚所教的手法，自己虽然学会了，却给对方抢先用出。,"'No! Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back. Misty had beaten him to it! He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.","Wu Xiaowang said, ""I won't!"" He wanted to stretch his back out and turn him over. Suddenly, his back was aching from being pinched by Xiao Renjie's thumb. The two spots where his hands were strangled had been taught to him by his father yesterday.","I wouldn't!' cried Trinket, as he was attempting to lift him back on to his feet, but as he felt for a sign indicating where the pain was, his small-knife sense of smell led him to recognize a pair ofRouting points in the back of his vest pocket which seemed to denote some difficulty that might be involved in struggling; for the next thing he knew, his both-hand grasp on this last moment was overruled by Misty, who used the time during which she had been holding him there to notice somewhere around the waist where something stiff and tight had been锁定。","Wu Xiaoya said, ""No surrender!"" He wanted to stand up, but suddenly his waist felt numb. The two meridians on his back were already blocked by the little Devil. This was exactly what Little Devil had taught him last night. Although he had learned it, it was given away to someone else.","Take no alliance!' Trinket called back, trying to raise his head again, but suddenly rather numb all round. There was a point on his lower back at which the old eunuch had taught him the kylix手法—— or so he thought. It had clearly been used before he knew what he was doing.","Then he said, 'No! I won't!"" He wanted to stand up straight and lift his legs off the ground, but a sudden pain shot through his back as his right hip was suddenly hit by a small monk's palm, which was precisely what the last night's teacher had taught him. Although he had learned it, he had been given a chance to use it against him.""","No!' insisted Trinket, struggling to get up again. But just as he did this, there was a sudden sharp pain to his back, and two tiny holes in his jeans became painful enough to keep him stopping him each time he struck. The important things were that Misty had somehow known to invoke this trick in front of him and that he had guessed it at some distance; but even so he had won't have gotten the better of him.","Wu Xiaole said: ""No surrender!"" He was about to rise up by his waist when he suddenly felt a sour pain in his lower back. The two points of his waist were blocked by the Little Nine Dragons. Those were the techniques that the Sea Husband had taught him last night. Although he had learned them, they were used before he could react.","Take no chances!' said Trinket, crumpling up his pants, and just at that moment he became conscious of a sudden shock running down from his waist to his lower back, and there, on the small of his back, he felt the tiny pricks of tiny fingers. These were the techniques taught to him by Old Hai the night before, but this time it was the man himself who had employed them.","Never!"" he said. He wanted to stretch out his back and raise himself up like a horseman. Suddenly, as if something was about to happen inside his waist, a strange pain came from his side. The two spots of the back were already covered by his disciple's finger-thrusting technique, which was what he had learned, but it had been given to him first by the other person.","No!' cried Trinket, as muscles beginning to hurt in his lower backgyms did轻微的剧痛。 'I won't!' but then a couple of little knots caused by the pain set him grinningly and the two打通的血管紧迫开来。","Wu Xiaole said, ""I will not bow!"" He wanted to turn his back, but suddenly a sharp pain ran down his waist. Two spots of pain on his back were already blocked by the little Nezha’s fingers. These were the same technique that he had learned from Little Nezha last night. Even though he had learned it, it was already too late for him.","The Treaty's not broken!' said Trinket, though it was clear that he was trying very hard not to leap forward and throw the guy a big time. Suddenly there was a sharp shock running down the back of his body, and the last two points of the Last Remainder were now pressed against his skin. It was every bit the old man's version of what Trinket had learned yesterday, but now that the other guy had made his move, there was nothing for it but for him to follow suit."

Grandmother became cold to her, and she told her parents about this disappointment. On the other hand, Granddad appeared to Grandma to be being spiteful; he told her not to take the brothers' girlfriends too lightly, expressing himself as if it were a sign of weakness.","She had longed for marriage since childhood but from her female companion’s vague whisper of a maimed son of the Tan family, she could not help feeling that her family would never be able to afford such a wedding.

潘寒露出神秘的笑容说：“不错，但假如构成计算机的三千万个士兵，每个人在一秒钟内可以挥动黑白小旗十万次，总线上的轻骑兵的奔跑速度是几倍音速甚至更快，结果就不一样了。,"Pan gave a mysterious smile. 'You're right. But suppose that of the thirty million soldiers forming the computer, each one is capable of raising and lowering the black and white flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster. Then the result would be very different.","Pang Ling smiled and said, ""Not bad, but if you have 1 million soldiers on a computer, each could swing the black flag ten thousand times in a second, and its light infantry would be faster than the speed of sound or even faster than the speed of light. The results wouldn't be exactly the same.""","Pan smiled triumphantly. 'That doesn't underestimate the difficulty of constructing a computer from three million soldiers. If each soldier in the army could have fired a color flag every second, the speed of a million troops would be much faster than the sound of a typical horse running at four times the speed of sound—different indeed.","Pan Han smiled mysteriously and said, ""That’s right, but if a million soldiers were assembled to form a computer, each of them could swing their black-and-white flags 100,000 times per second, and the speed of the light cavalry would be several times the speed of sound or even faster. The result would be different.""","Pan smiled神秘地。 'No, but if so... let's say there are three million soldiers in our computer. And each of them waves its black-and-white flag a thousand times per second. Then the speed of the horseless trains running on the network is several times the speed of sound or even faster. The result would be different.","Pan Lin smiled and said, ""That’s right, but if each of the three million soldiers on the battlefield can move a white flag every ten seconds, the speed of light runners on the line is even faster than sound – it will result in something different.","Pan smiled triumphantly. 'That's not bad. But if the number of soldiers in the world's computers were equal to three million, say one hundred million each. So, counting them all, the total output of flags would be ten trillion times the rate at which the average soldier trundled a car. That would result in very different thoughts.","Pang Han revealed a mysterious smile, ""Right, but if each of the three million soldiers constitute a computer, they can swing their black-and-white flags 100,000 times per second on the total network, the speed of the light cavalry is faster than several times the speed of sound even.""","Pan laughed mysteriously. 'No, but if we assume that our computer is made up of three million soldiers, each of whom waves his or her black-and-white flag a thousand times per second, there would be so much jockeying for position on the network cables that they'd move at the speed of sound or faster. The result would be very different.","Pan Chen smiled mysteriously. ""That's right.

只觉天涯茫茫，到处是鞑子的天下，真无一片干净土地，沉吟道：“桃源何处，可避暴秦？,"The whole world belonged to the Tartars now, it seemed. Not a single patch of land was free of their hated presence.

Finally Dang introduced them to the metaphorical oasis of Utopia. 'Where can we hide ourselves, O Great Duke? When all Heaven is filled with Mongoys?","Only that all is foreign, everywhere is a barbarous world; really there is no one clean land, pondering thoughtfully: ""Where shall I hide from the barbarians?","But everywhere he looked it was the Tartar way, and there is really not a patch of unaltered soil in this vast empire where he could hide himself in tranquillity. 'And what can there be of enchanting allure in the桃花源?","Only felt that the world was endless, everywhere were the Qing Dynasty, there was no clean land, pondered, ""Where is the peach valley, can escape from the暴秦?""","The journey was indeed bewildering; all of China, in his view, was now in the power of the Tartars, and everywhere the prospect of finding even a single shelter from the wrath of the Empire seemed remote and渺茫. He murmured to himself: 'What is this 'Canyon of Sorrow' business?","Only then did I realize that the world was full of the tyrants, and there was no clean land to hide one's feet. True is it, that all the places where the wicked oppressors live are all over the earth. What is this place where I could avoid the evil?","But all along the road were impenetrable mountains of Tатraland, full of隐遁之地如焚琴片铁之竹林之国、高粱阻雾诸人之白驹之国、碧柳堤畔、黄龙谷下。","I felt that the world was full of the Qing Empire, with no clean land anywhere. I said, ""Where is the place for a person to escape from a tyrannical emperor?""","His eyes travelled unceasingly across the desolate landscape.

这时，她倒平静下来，心情也松弛了，等那化妆师结束工作走开时，她甚至还生出几分幽默感同吴佩珍开玩笑。 吴佩珍说她简直像是嫦娥下凡，她就说嫦娥也是月饼盒上的嫦娥，于是两人都笑。,"It was then that she began to calm down and her tensions eased. By the time the makeup man finished his job, she had even started to regain her sense of humor and joked around a bit with Wu Peizhen, who remarked that Wang Qiyao looked like the Lady in the Moon descending into the secular world, whereupon Wang Qiyao quipped that if she were a Lady in the Moon, she was the kind whose image was found on boxes of mooncakes. The two of them had a good laugh.","At that moment, she calmed down, her mood relaxed, when the make-up artist was done working and left the stage. She even felt a little bit of humor towards Gao Pingxin. Gao Pingxin said that she looked like the moon goddess from another planet, and so did I. They both laughed.","Back then, she had calmed down and was in a good mood. When the makeup man finished his painting, she even took it as a compliment when he mentioned that Wang Qiyao was like the moon on her birthday, and that she was also an月饼盒子上的月亮，两人立刻就笑了。","At this moment, she was calm again and her mood relaxed. Even when the makeup artist finished his work and walked away, she even had a bit of humor with Wu Peizhen. Wu Peizhen said that she looked like a goddess coming down from the moon. She then said that the goddess was also a lady on a moon cake box. So they both laughed.","All of a sudden, she was surprisingly calm, and even gave Wang Qiyao a joke. Wang Qiyao imitated the beauty's accent and laugh out loud; then she changed the subject, saying how much she looked like the goddess Chang Yun (the box cake ad represented her as a beautiful woman with a full head of hair). They both laughed.","At that moment, she calmed down, her spirits also relaxed, when the make-up artist was finished working and had gone away. She even had a chuckle at Gao Peixian's joke. Gao Peixian said that she looked like the moon goddess from Heaven, so I said the same thing about the moon goddess on the box of the moon goddess. Then both of them laughed.","After a while, she became quite calm and her anxiety disappeared. When the makeup man was done and going back inside, Wang Qiyao even had fun teasing her—she even said that he was as talented as the moon女神琦瑶，在她眼中两人又都笑了。","Then she relaxed and her mood improved as the make-up artist finished his work. Even when he left, she was still amused at how she had been compared to the moon goddess on the box of mooncakes. They both laughed.","All of a sudden, she felt calm and relaxed even as the makeup man left. For a few moments, she had even felt humorous; she imitated Wu Peizhen as the Lady Lien in The Nightingale and the Rose. 'I am like the moon on the cake stand,' she said, 'like the moon that comes out of the box.' So they both laughed.","And now, she calms down, her mood relaxes as well, when the makeup artist is done working and leaves. She even has a little humor from Gai's jokes. Gai said that she was like the moon goddess on earth, so I said she was also the one of the moon box with the moon goddess on it. Then they both burst out laughing.","After a while, she became very calm and relaxed. She even laughed out loud when the makeup man finished his job, and Wang Qiyao said her friend was like the moon landing on earth. She responded by saying that maybe it was because of Wu Peizhen's imagination, who responded with another laugh.","Now she felt calm, her mood relaxing, and even though she was being made fun of by Rui Pei-zhen, she could not help but laugh along with her.","But at that moment she changed, probably because the audience was no longer tense. When the makeup man finally left, she even felt somewhat amused; she pretended to be Wu Peizhen's cousin and say that she looked like Wang Rui's mooncake had come alive, to which Wu Peizhen replied that the cake had been made by a goddess. So they both laughed."
一已开进门去，院子是浅的，客堂也是浅的，三步两步便走穿过去，一道木楼梯挡在了头顶。,"But, upon entering, one discovers that the courtyard is modest and the reception area narrow—two or three steps and you are already at the wooden staircase across the room.","I entered the house through a narrow door, the garden was shallow, the guest room was shallow, I walked past it for three steps and then came across a wooden stairway that blocked my path.","She went back inside, though the courtyard was more narrow than deep; and once inside, she walked straight ahead, where a set number of steps led her directly above the room above.","As soon as I opened the door, the courtyard was shallow, the hall also shallow, three steps two steps walked past, a wooden stairway blocked above my head.",Entering one could not help but notice how shallow the courtyard and guest-room were; a wooden flight of steps blocked his view.,"I went through a door, and the yard was shallow, and the guest room was shallow as well.

There was a wooden staircase blocking our way.","She went back inside, arriving at the entrance passageway in a shallow courtyard, and walking along the staircase remained a step or two above the threshold above which the three丈十尺高的石阶阻住了她的视线。","As soon as I opened the door, the courtyard was shallow, and the living room was also shallow, so that I could walk through it in three or two steps. There was a wooden staircase above my head blocking my way.","The threshold is low; so are the storeys inside.

只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。,"Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.","Just as the brothers, parents, etc., do not dare to contradict or violate the instruction of the saint; so they just don’t want to make any difference at all.

He knows that if he was to be a good grandfather he would have to do his best to lead his grandchildren by example.","Only fathers, uncles, brothers, etc., who are descendants of the Holy Man, do not dare to violate the instructions, so between brothers, it is just enough for them to do what they can. They don't want to be a model for their younger brothers either.","But as ancestors of Confucius have imposed upon us as sacred laws of behavior, we should dare not contrary them in any our sons, and so, even though the relationships between us may be somewhat different, we limit our actions to the most elementary details and do not presume on our young manhood to give an example不合 with these.","Just the family relationships of father, uncle, brother, for they have been set down as a sacred instruction by the great masters, so there is no need to break off or change anything, just to give them a general idea, not wanting to be a man, and should take their sons as models.","Now,' said Father, 'regarding our relationship as such special and inflexible as properties which could have no derogation, we follow the custom of leaving it to other men to clarify matters to the maximum. We consider that our son's qualities make him not a man's example, but a father's.","Only those relations of father, uncle, and brother, being forebears of Confucius, dare not transgress them; so brothers do not have much to say about their behavior.

They were local folks of that name. Their ancestor had once been a small chief of the capital city's Ministry of the State before he became a eunuch for Queen Wang's wife.

国家兴亡，匹夫有责，暂时避祸则可，但若去躲在桃花源里，逍遥自在，忍令亿万百姓在鞑子铁蹄下受苦，于心何安？,"The citizen of a conquered country still has his duty. It's all very well to take temporary refuge, but to live a life of ease in some Peach Tree Haven while millions are suffering under the iron heel of the Tartars would be less than human.","The country's prosperity is at stake; we can be there temporarily if we hide behind a garden of flowers or live free from the shackles of government control. But if we stay in a place where people suffer under the iron fist of their enemies, how could our hearts be at peace?","Where do you want to hide when the country is in trouble?'-well, you can't stay at a far-off place like roses; your conscience won't allow you. But let us pretend to live in舒服的桃花源，and when the噩梦来临，当真的落到那芸念炎黄的铁枪和铜炮中，那可是死也不甘于命!","Responsibility for the fate of a country lies with all citizens. It is possible to temporarily avoid trouble but one must not hide away in some idyllic place, living life on the easy road. One must endure watching the suffering of millions of people at the mercy of the Tartar yoke.","Those who see themselves as responsible for their country should not shy away from facing up to the problems now confronting it. Temporal power is all that matters in the end, and hiding away in a green gourd's paradise is not going to cut it. If so doing were enough to protect them from ultimate disaster, we might question whether they were doing their duty; but it is estimated that tens of thousands of innocent souls in Russia are currently suffering under the yoke of the Tartars, and yet not a soul among them has dared to hide away rather than face up to the truth.","The nation's prosperity depends on us, so we can go out for a little while when necessary; but if we hide behind the Forbidden City, it is impossible for us to be free. What does that make our hearts?","Where do you want to hide?' I asked when we first arrived at Tangente. The place to live out our time here temporarily would have been a fair place to call home if we had chosen it. But we could only stay so long—hell, why should we?","Responsibility for a nation's rise or fall is on every citizen, but if one chooses to hide away in a ""utopia"" like a garden, how can they feel at peace with themselves knowing that their fellow citizens are suffering under the yoke of the Mongol horsemen?","Those who see themselves as responsible for their country should not shy away from doing what is necessary to avert it. In the short term such action would be justified; but to retreat into a utopia made of blooming apricots is not only enabling millions of subjects to kneel unceasingly under the Tartar iron foot, but utterly unacceptable.","The state of one's nation is in the hands of those who govern it; when you go there temporarily, you can do something about it. But if you stay behind in the land of the peasants and let them suffer under the iron heel of the conquerors, how can you feel at ease?","If there's to be national salvation,' he thought, 'I should at least prefer a life of luxury in a far-off valley where the roses and daises of heaven can be seen every day.","Responsibility is something that belongs to every person, whether it be rich or poor. It’s always better to stay away from trouble temporarily, but if one chooses to hide in a utopia of his own making, then he should bear the responsibility for the suffering of millions of people under the yoke of the Mongols.","Even though the individual may feel at times like he is part of a safe haven, like Liu Bei in his Emerald Tunnel, it is not without consequence to put off the problems of nation on the one hand and of individual conscience on the other."

高粱棵子里似乎有痛苦的呻吟声，尸体堆中好像有活物的蠕动，父亲想唤住爷爷，去看看这些尚未死利索的乡亲。 他仰起脸来，看到爷爷那副绿锈斑斑、丧失了人的表情的青铜面孔，把话儿压进了喉咙。,"Tortured moans emerged from the field of sorghum, and here and there among the bodies some movement appeared.

He raised his eyes to look at the iron-faced bronze face of his grandfather, and pressed the words into his mouth.","The sorghum fields seemed to啼哭, moving corpses within their nests looked as if alive; Father thought for a moment that he should go and see the dead, but Granddad's greenly scarred, decimated face blocked its desire.","The corn stalks seemed to be moaning with pain, while the corpses seemed to be moving, Father wanted to call out to his grandfather and go and see these people who had not yet died. He raised his face and saw Grandfather's face, which was covered with green rust stains and lacked human expression, and he choked back the words.","Father heard muffled cries coming from hidden places in the sorghum fields, and felt the earth move under his feet as he saw batches of corpses wriggling out of their graves, calling for him. He gazed up until the bruised metal face of Granddad penetrated the thick haze of emotion that choked him.","There is a mournful sound in the mill of the young man's graveyards, and there is a soft moving in the corpses at the side of the road. He looked up from his head, seeing the wrinkled face of the grandfather who was in poor health, with a loss of human expression on his copper-faced face. He put the words into his mouth.","The sorghum fields seemed to scream out with pain; corpses in the field moved slowly through the roots as though moving alive, causing Father to want to reach out and see the recently dead, apparently僵化到极限的同胞们。","There seemed to be a moaning sound from inside the sorghum stalks, and there was a movement of living things among the corpses. He wanted to call out to his grandfather, to go and see these still living people who were not yet dead. He raised his face, seeing the green rust stains on his grandfather's faceless, expressionless bronze face as he tried to speak, but it was swallowed by his throat.","Sobs echoed in the sorghum fields, corpses twitched in the mounds; Father wanted to call out to Granddad, to see what was wrong with these poor souls who had not yet died of old. He raised his face, until his eyes were buried deep in the redness of his rusted-out face, and called out, but his voice got caught in his throat.","In the milker's yard there was a faint sound of sorrow; the corpses in the graveyard seemed to have some living creatures moving about, while his father wanted to call up his aged grandfather to see those still unharmed from death. He raised his eyes and saw that the rough-faced face of his uncle, whose face had been tarnished with age, was being pressed into his throat.","The sorghum fields seemed to scream out with suffering; corpses strewn across the field appeared to move slowly in front of eyes, causing Father to raise his head, see the green-brown, well-machined copper face that had turned disconsolate, and press back those hidden feelings.","In the stalks of sorghum there seemed to be a moaning sound of pain, and among the corpses, there were movements that suggested living things. He wanted to call out to his grandfather to see if they had not yet died cleanly.

他迷迷糊糊的睡了一会，悄悄起身，把那盒蜜饯糕饼揣在怀里，生怕惊醒海老公，慢慢一步步的蹑足而出，走到门边，轻轻拔开了门闩，再轻轻打开了一扇门，突然听得海老公问道：“小桂子，你去哪里？”,"After sleeping fitfully for what must have been several hours, he got up silently, stuffed the box of cakes inside his breast pocket,and made his way on tiptoe across the room, pausing at each step for fear the old eunuch might waken. Then, slowly and gently, he slid back the door-bar and opened one of the leaves of the door. At that very moment he heard the old eunuch's voice calling out from behind him. 'Laurie, where are you going?'","He was drowsy for a moment before he slowly rose from his bed, and took the honey rolls and cookies in his pocket, fearing that they would wake up his husband, so quietly he walked along with him slowly until he reached the door and then gently opened the lock of the door, hearing his wife say in a low voice, ""Where did you go, little桂子？""","But for a moment or two he was asleep until the old eunuch came冲击着他，悄声如鼠地从他身后悄悄走过，轻轻打开门，一睁眼，只见海老公站在门口，微笑道: ""小桂子，你去了哪里？」","He fell asleep for a while and got up quietly. He put the box of sweet confection in his pocket, afraid to wake up his husband. He slowly walked out one step at a time and reached the door. He opened it gently and suddenly heard his husband ask, ""Little Gaozi, where are you going?""","He slept vaguely for a while, too sleepy to dream, as he slipped out of bed, slid the box inside his jacket, and very carefully made his way to the door. With great care he inserted the catch and opened the door just a crack; then, very quietly, he slipped outside and drew the door open again, just above the old man's next question.","He was asleep for a moment, then he got up slowly, put the honey cake and pastry in his pocket, hoping not to wake up his husband. He stealthily walked out one step at a time, stepping through the door, then heard his husband say, ""Little桂子，你在哪儿呢？""","Not knowing where he had fallen asleep, he got up from bed, surreptitiously stuffing the cake in his pocket, though he soon found he could not see the old eunuch when he stepped out of bed. He slowly strode towards the gate with the door open; then he heard the old eunuch asking, 'Little Liu, where have you been?'","He dozed off for a while, quietly getting up, taking the box of sweet cakes out of his pocket, afraid to wake up the sea husband, slowly making his way to the door, pulling the lock open with care, then opening another door slightly, suddenly hearing the sea husband say: ""Little Guozi, where are you going?""","He dozed off for a while on the floor without answering, then quietly slipped the box of Tartlets to himself.

Suddenly he heard Old Hai ask, 'Laurel, where are you going?'","He was slumbering for a while, then quietly got up and took the honey cake and almond mousse out of his pocket, afraid that he would wake up his husband. He slowly walked slowly, with each step taking him closer to the door, but when he heard his wife say, ""Little Guanzi, where have you gone?""","But he did not keep清醒状态太久， getting ready to go off into the night silently, but careful as a chicken, he slowly undulated his way around the bend and out of view, opening a little door cautiously and speaking to the old eunuch, 'Little Chang, where have you been?'","He dozed off for a while, got up quietly, took out the box of sweet confection, hoping not to wake the sea husband, slowly making his way out of the room step by step until he reached the door. He gently opened the door, suddenly heard the sea husband say, ""Little Gaozi, where are you going?""","He drifted into a state of dim consciousness for a while, when, quietly getting up, he slipped the box of cakes and sweets into his pocket.

The vixen rose up from the south, the tusk from the north fell from the wall, and unhappy Bellamy's wife — she would be hung for lacking a block of brick, and miserable Bellamah to jump into the river....']","The night sky is a gray grape, golden wind winds through the river, the blue sky deep as infinity, the green stars shine brightly.

The all-seeing Sun is held down by a forked star, the fated Sun does not shine, but the lucky Star does — though its handle is missing from the bottle gourd dish. The broken-up glazed jar is held up by two protruding corners; the牛郎 and the fairy are so worried about their fate that they hang their heads and prepare to die, respectively.","The night is gray grapes, winds blow through a river of gold; the blue sky is vast and deep, and green stars shine brightly. The北斗七星——the star that died by the北斗主——is a symbol of death, while the constellation of the southern zodiac——the zodiac sign of the south——is a symbol of life. The eight corner glasses — the one missing from each corner of the eight corner glasses——are a reminder of the lack of a piece of stone in the constellation of the moon, which is burning with anger. The sorrowful mother of the Virgin Mary is hanging on her head. The sorrowful wife of the Starry Messenger is floating down the river of water.","The night almost pitch black, the red sunset illuminating the golden waters of the canal. The blue sky was unobstructed, without boundaries. Green stars shone bright, the北斗勺子星—its master dead, the Northern Bell Pole—was wobbly; the spotter's cowrie—its main body missing, a block of bricks, or the one-year bird—the one-year watcher wanted to hang it up, the mother of troubled females—to jump.... All three were hanging from their heads.","Black grapes under the night sky, golden wind weaving rivers, a deep blue sky, brilliant stars, and green stars. The勺子北斗——主死了，簸箕南斗——司生，八角玻璃井——少一块砖头，焦灼的牛郎要上吊，忧愁的织女要跳河……都在头顶挂着。","As the purple evening winds circled the canal, and the golden wind blew through the rivers and canals, Bao Blue Sky grew deep and deep until the stars shone brightly even in the sky overcast with black. The Bottle Neck Star pointed to the dead Sun, and the Dipper Star pointed to the living Moon; but Nanguan Lantern Jia was about to hang himself and Milky Way Girl was about to jump into the hole."

吴佩珍本来对片厂没有多少准备，她的向往是因王琦瑶而生的向往，她自然是希望片厂越精彩越好，可究竟是什么样的精彩，心中却是没数的，所以她是要看王琦瑶的态度再决定她的意见。,"Wu Peizhen had never had her sights set on the studio. Her reason for going rested entirely in making Wang Qiyao happy, so naturally she had hoped it would be a wonderful trip. Just what was so wonderful about the film studio, however, Wu Peizhen had not the slightest clue—she had to wait for Wang Qiyao's reaction to find out.","Gina Ye Gong had no preparation for this company before she entered.

So she would wait for Wang Qiuyue’s attitude before making her decision.","Wu Peizhen had not shown much interest in the film studio going in; the attraction that she felt for it grew out of Wang Qiyao's statements that she 'longed' to take pictures at the studio. She wanted the studio to be as glamorous as possible, but just how glamorous exactly and what Wang Qiyao meant by her expression that she would decide whether to go ahead or not on the basis of their reactions to each other, she had no idea. So she waited for Wang Qiyao's reaction.","Gao Peixue had no preparation for the film factory before her. She was a girl who had never prepared for anything, her dream of being a part of the film industry was born from Wang Yuqiao. Of course she wanted to see the films as they were; however, she did not know what kind of films were beautiful enough to be seen, so she had no idea how many beautiful films there were. Therefore, she wanted to decide her opinion on whether or not to see the films based on what Wang Yuqiao said.","As for Wu Peizhen, she had no preparation whatsoever at the studio; her hope was based on Wang Qiyao, a hope that the studio was to be celebrated for. After all, what quality of film was she interested in seeing?

他自觉得胜，心下高兴，只是小郡主不会说话，未免有些扫兴，要想去解她穴道，却又不知其法，说道：“你给人点了穴道，倘若解不开，不能吃饭，岂不饿死了？,"It was agreeable to have won, but it rather took the gloss off his victory that she couldn't speak. He would have liked to open the vital points that would enable her to do so, but he didn't know how. 'Now that your vital points are closed, you can't eat,' he said. 'If they're not opened, you'll just starve to death.","He felt that he had won and was happy; but his little cousin would not speak. It might be a bit of a pity, for she could not eat when she did not understand how to open her穴位。 He said, ""If you have given me a穴位，you will never be able to open it again. What do you mean by saying 'Open my穴位'?""","But as far as he was concerned he was above all things benefitting, while the Little Countess had little to do besides him to occupy his thoughts; and still less, it turned out, than finding her open for a coup de grace when some one came to investigate her health. If she couldn't open her up by giving a good signal, the practitioner would not give food and drink unless he knew what he was doing.","He felt that he had won, and his heart was filled with joy. However, as a young lady, she could not speak, which made him feel disappointed. He wanted to open her meridians, but he did not know how to do it. He said, ""If you were beaten up and couldn't open your wounds, wouldn't you starve to death?","By the time he had won the contest and was going to go out of his way to make the Little Countess' disappointment as complete as possible, she was still too young to understand the full implications of his words. He had in fact no intention of hurting her feelings, but was merely being naïvely optimistic that she would find something amusing in the situation. 'When people have their acupuncture points blocked, if they don't know what they're doing, they won't be able to eat any more,' he said, 'and that will kill them. So you'd better not let yourself be blocked!","He felt himself victorious, his heart was pleased, but the little prince did not speak, it might be a pity that he would have no means of knowing how to open her door, saying: ""If you point out a way for me to open my door, if I cannot eat after doing so, what will happen?","But as far as he was concerned all were pleased; but there can be no knowing how to do it yet, for he knew that if the Little Countess's mother hadn't picked a fight and given her a place to beat, she would certainly make his job of extracting her secret much harder than it ought to have been.","He felt victorious and was pleased with himself, but he could not help feeling disappointed that his little lady couldn't speak. If he wanted to try to open her up, he didn't know how to do it either. He said, ""If you're unable to open the holes on your body, you'll starve to death!","He felt good about himself, though the Little Countess's silence was a source of disappointment. He could see that if she couldn't speak, it would be a long time before she got over her present misfortune; so while he was feeling pleased with himself, he didn't go exploring her穴 points just in case he might do something to open them, for he didn't know what the right way was. 'If someone had laid you hold of and put these knots on your body, and if you couldn't eat because of them, being unable to open them up, you'd be in a very bad condition indeed,' he said.","He felt that he had won, and his heart was happy, but it seemed to him that his little sister would not speak, so she would be somewhat disappointed, and when he wanted to find her a way out of her mouth, he could not know how to do it, saying: ""If you have given me a point of exit, if I cannot eat with it, what will happen to you?","But as a matter of fact he was probably the winner; pleased pleased he was, but for the lack of language he felt that his success would be一世之短。 'If your wife has had her穴位点了许多次', he thought, 'she wouldn't be able to feed properly if she can't open them. And it would be very starving. I don't know how to help her—'","He felt he had won, so his heart was happy, but the little lady couldn't speak, which made him a bit disappointed. He wanted to try to open her up, but he didn't know how. ""If you were given a point of no return, if you can't break it, wouldn't you die from hunger?!""","The completeness of his self-perception pleased him. However, the lack of言语中的乐趣使她显得有点丧气。她本想告诉他穴道解不开会怎样,但是不知道怎么开口,只道:「人被人点中了穴道,要是动弹不了,吃也吃不下。"

他想着：“兄弟们一并都有父母教训，何必我多事，反生疏了。 况且我是正出，他是庶出，饶这样看待，还有人背后谈论，还禁得辖治了他？”,"'We are both equally subject to our parents' control,' he would say of himself and Jia Huan. 'Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife's son and he is the concubine's? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.'","He thought: ""The brothers all have parents' lessons; why do I bother? If that were the case, we would have been good friends. And what if I am a real man, he is a peasant, and I should see things as they are, so that there would be others who talk behind his back, and still govern him?""","That's just it,' he thought. 'Both of us will have parents' advice when we reach age; but the trouble is that I am a prospective scholar, she a commoner; and since I'm only at the beginning of my studies, compared with which they are both proficient I should be punished very reasonably. If there were such people as them to talk about and do anything else like that, I should have to put mine into practice very badly. But what I must remember is that they are only men, not women; and although they may speak ill of me publicly or私下，I am sure they shall be stopped before their words reach my mouth. And besides, even if they did do me any harm, I shouldn't feel need to deal with them publicly. '","He thought: ""My brothers will be punished by their parents as well, why should I bother? It is more likely that I would become distant if I were to take care of this matter myself. Besides, my father is the firstborn, he has no need for a second child, so it's fine with me to look after him. But how can I allow others to speak ill of him behind my back?""","Things are worse than bad in one respect: all the errors of which I might be guilty are to be shared by the rest of the clan, so that there will be no cause for feeling inferior about my own shortcomings. Besides, I am the main source from whom this blame falls, whereas the other boys can evade it because they are only庶子; whereas my being the elder is counting against me. Even if there were no忌讳， my indiscretions could not so easily get out.'","He thought: ""The brothers have parents' instruction, why bother me? Besides, I am a senior citizen, he is a junior citizen, so what about this kind of treatment? And there are still others who talk behind his back, and they should be restrained.""","So he began by addressing his younger brothers. 'Both of us will have a father's instructions one way or the other. If we're not careful, our relations could become distant. After all, I am a candidate, and you are a Candidate-out. There is no cause for concern if we don't treat our relations properly; yet it would be very wrong to treat them unfairly. Then there would be others against us to go back on our word with, so I think it best that we should keep our relations correctly treated.","He thought: ""Why should I be so troublesome? It would be too awkward for me. Furthermore, he is my elder brother who has a father, while I am his younger brother with no father, so how could I not look at him as someone with some authority? And then, there will be people behind my back talking about this matter, which I can't even manage.""","They have tutors to discipline them,' he thought; 'why should I go bothering about it? It would be awkward for them, and besides I am the chief one responsible, while there is always talk behind their backs and gossiping. What should I know about self-discipline?'","He thought, ""All my brothers have parents' advice; why should I be so troublesome? Besides, I am a senior citizen myself, and there is no need for me to speak ill of him. And how about what others say behind his back? Would it not be better if he was treated well?""","So he thought, their parents have surely looked out for them and done everything possible to see that their interests were met, yet even if they were high school students (which they were now) they had only the same rights as their erstwhile uncles and aunties; what would happen to them if they were treated unfairly or their interests were disregarded?","He thought, "" Brothers all have parents' discipline, why should I bother about it? Besides, as I am born right out of the door, he is born from a lesser door, so let's just treat him lightly, but still, there will be people talking behind my back, how can I be able to control him?""","They get taught by their brothers as well,' he thought. ‘Why should it be my duty to take them in hand? I could easily alienate them by doing so, especially since one of us is a principal citizen while the other a commoner, and there would be no one to restrain their backbiting.’"

沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏幕上出现一条平直的绿线，“你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是2.726±0.010K，那个误差是银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。,"As he spoke, Sha typed quickly at the terminal. Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen. 'This curve is the real-time measurement of the overall cosmic microwave background—oh, calling it a straight line would be more accurate. The temperature is 2.725±0.002K. The error range is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the Milky Way, which has already been filtered out.","Speaking of it, I am working on screen, and immediately there is a line that appears flat on top of the screen - 'Look, this is the current global background radiation curve. Oh, you'd say that's straight, but the number is 2.726 ± 0.010 K, which is a correction for the Doppler effect caused by galactic motion. That has been filtered out.'",Sha said as he moved around the table. 'The current global background radiation is a straight line. So ',"Shashier says as he starts typing on his terminal, a straight green line appears on the screen quickly, “That’s the current cosmic background radiation real-time numerical curve, oh, it should be called a straight line, its numerical value is 2.726 ± 0.010 Kelvin, that error is due to the Doppler effect of the galactic motion, which has already been filtered out.”",Sha began entering command after command into the terminal. Soon a simple line appeared on the screen: GREEN SHAPE CURRENT BACKGROUND RIEMAN LINE READ: 2.726 DEGREE OF FREEZE-TONE TEMPERATURE (THE ERROR IS THE REDUCTION of this temperature due to the motion of the solar wind) FILTERED OUT.,"Shao Ruixin said that he was busy on the screen. A line of green lines appeared, ""Look! This is the current global background radiation curve. Oh, it should be called a straight line. The number is 2.726 ± 0.010 K, and this error is caused by the Doppler effect of the Milky Way. It has been filtered out.""","Sha answered, where he sat fell back in front of his computer's screen. A green line directly above it appeared. 'Look there. That is the current cosmic background radiation real-time data, plotted on a flat green curve. Ah, no, I don't want to call this 'nameless. The curve shows the reaction time between the waves traveling throughout the universe. There's a TeV-scale effect called relativistic dispersion caused by motion within the universe. I've filtered that noise to remove the names.","Shashier Mountain said as he began working on his terminal. In a few moments, a straight green line appeared on the screen. ""Look, that's the current global background radiation real-time numerical curve. Oh, it should be called a line, not a curve. The value is 2.726 ± 0.010 K. That error is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the galaxy. It has already been filtered out.""","Sha began typing away at his computer. In less than a minute a green line appeared on the screen. 'Here is the current overall temperature of the universe,' he said. 'Again, I apologize for calling it a line unless you consider the error due to the motion of the galaxy. The error is plus or minus one degree Kelvin, called the redshift caused by the galaxy moving toward us.","Shen Ruixin said that he was busy on the terminal. The screen displayed a straight green line, ""Look, this is the current global background radiation real-time numerical curve, I think it should be called a line, and its value is 2.726 ± 0.010 K, that's what we're talking about here. It's caused by galactic motion effects. We've already removed that.""","Sha answered, where he sat侃侃而谈起来。很快屏幕上显示出了一个 静止的绿色 曲线。 Sha said there was a straight line indicating the real-time numerical value of the cosmic microwave background, so yes, 'line' is what he used when discussing it on a plane. The noise-free continuous graph showed a slope of ± 0.01. That error was caused by the relativistic effect produced by astrophysicist's movements in the universe. They had filtered it out.","Shashier said, as he was busy on the terminal, a green line appeared on the screen quickly. ""Look, this is the real-time value of current overall cosmic background radiation. Oh, it should be called a straight line, with a value of 2.726 ± 0.010 K. That error is caused by the Doppler effect from the galaxy’s motion, which has been filtered out.""","Sha began typing away at his computer. In less than a minute a vertical green line appeared on the screen. 'There it is: that's the current state of the universe as observed by the WMAP satellite. Oh, I'm calling it a line for simplicity, though that's only an average. The temperature is 2.726 plus/minus 0.010 Kelvin. The error is due to the multiple reflections of light from the moving solar system. It has been filtered out.'"

轿夫抬轿从街上走，迈的都是八字步，号称“踩街”，这一方面是为讨主家欢喜，多得些赏钱； 另一方面，是为了显示一种优雅的职业风度。,"As the bearers carried their load down the path, their feet left a series of V imprints known as 'tramples' in the dirt, for which satisfied clients usually rewarded them, and which fortified the bearers' pride of profession.","A man lifts a carriage from the street, walking with a straight line as if he were going to go out for a walk, that is, ""to make the guest happy."" This aspect of his behavior was to get some money, and also to show a professional style of life.","In the tradition of the八字跑， the sedan bearers now walked down the streets holding their patients; like the horsemen of the town, this was not just a matter for accruing rewards—but as a way of showing off an official kind of skill.","Lifters carry carriages down the street in their eightfold step, which is known as ""walking the streets."" On one hand, it pleases the owner by getting him more money; on the other hand, it shows a graceful profession.","Down on the street they moved like an army of foot soldiers, their steps in八字, a technique called'踩街'. They were performing for the sake of winning the favour of their master and increasing their pay, but also to display an elegant, dignified working class style.","A carriage porter is walking across the street, with each step being a round one, which he is known for as ""hitting the streets."" This means that he was trying to attract attention by walking around the neighborhood. He also wanted to show off his profession's good looks.","When bearers carry the dead up the streets, they do the 'eighties' method. This is because it gives them an advantage over the competition: they can buy themselves some bonuses by pretending that they are doing a good job of conveying the solemnity of the deceased.","Lodgers carried boxes on their shoulders from the street.

好在吴佩珍是压得起的，她的人生任务不如王琦瑶来得重，有一点吃老本，也有一点不计较，本是一身轻，也是为王琦瑶分担的意思。,"It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her. This was partly because she had plenty of psychic capital to draw on, but also because she simply did not mind. Things came easy to her and she was willing to bear more than her share.","In other words, she is not burdened by her weight. There was a little bit of eating out-of-the-box, too, but there was also a bit of not-hating her, which meant that she had some of the same burden as Ouija's.","Fortunately Wu Peizhen was no weak-hearted woman who could bear any burden, and this allowed Wang Qiyao to focus on her duties as a mother and to accomplish not only her goals but even inspire Wu Peizhen with her successes.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is one who can handle it, for her life task is not as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's, and she has a little of ""not caring"" about things, meaning that she carries herself lightly and also helps Wang Qiuyue.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen can handle it all by herself. She does not have the responsibilities that Wang Qiyao does; in fact, she even gets to be relieved of some of her old-model status. Still, not putting all her energy into things and being unambitious come with their own set of problems—she is both a beneficiary and a contributor to Wang Qiyao's well-being.","In addition, Gu Pingxuan is not as heavy as Ouyang Yu'er. She has a life task that is not as heavy as hers, but there's also something that she doesn't care about. The person she is was just light, it meant that she was helping Ouyang Yu'er out.","There was that: Wu Peizhen was capable; her life task wasn't as serious as Wang Qiyao's, who had barely passed on from generation to generation but still had an aspiration to help Wu Peizhen. That was what gave Wu Peizhen a little bit of grace under pressure. As long as you knew which way the tide, you could at least be grateful.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is one who can bear it, her life mission isn't as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's, she has a little bit of living on past experience, a little bit of not caring about anything, which means that she is carrying a burden for Wang Qiuyue.","At least Wu Peizhen could handle this with her eyes firmly set on the future. She had fewer responsibilities than Wang Qiyao and, while she might not be fully compensated for her sacrifices, she was willing to make no excuses. She was, after all, living off her old capital, and was there to help Wang Qiyao shoulder some of hers.","She is not as heavy as Wang Qi'er, but her life task was not as heavy as Ouyang Qiren's. She had a little bit of old stock, too, and she didn't care about it much either. The essence of her existence was that she shared it with Wang Qi'er.","Wu Peizhen was not only a good candidate for the job; she was also the smarter one of the two. Her life task wasn't as heavy as Wang Qiyao's, but her contribution was still enough to help Wang Qiyao with. Both were taking their time over everything; Wu Peizhen was only maintaining old-school standards, just as Wang Qiyao had always have.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen is not heavy, her life mission is not as heavy as Wang Qiuyue's, she has a little eating old money, also has a little not caring about it, it was originally light body, but also for Wang Qiuyue's burden.","Fortunately, Wu Peizhen can afford to take her time. She has no life-weighted tasks as burdens as Wang Qiyao does, and she doesn't have to think about living up to the expectations of others. In fact, she lives with a body full of youthful energy but part of whose soul is also a desire to not exert herself too hard. Wang Qiyao is the one who benefits from all this."

因见上面大旨不过谈情，亦只是实录其事，绝无伤时诲淫之病，方从头至尾抄写回来，闻世传奇。,He could see that its main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher.,"Because it seems that there is no harm in merely recounting the matter as if it were a piece of news, and no damage to the spirit of love. Only after reading through its entirety should one copy back this text. It is from the beginning to the end.","But before his eyes could be been proved right, by a hidden message containing a number of cryptic words which seemed to speak of some secret and unsuspected objective, but which nevertheless imparted an intrinsic truthfulness, the original writer confesses without pretence any matter pertaining to love and lust, both above suspicion (for fear of复敌) and below law (for fear of punishment), and sets out what he has captured in an account so far as possible straight to the reader; but not a single word is profanity. The tale has therefore found its place in the annals of legend.","The above is just a discussion about love, which is merely a factual account of events, and there is no disease of indulging in sex or discussing immoral topics, so it has been copied from beginning to end.""","It is because your last message came straight from the heart, so thoroughly revised it contains not a word of scandalous or lustful matter that we have transcribed it from start to finish and published it as a new kind of romance.","Because what you said above is not just a summary of the general principle, but also actually records the actual facts. There is no harm in spreading such nonsense; you should return it from head to tail, so that you can hear about all the legends.","From this we perceive that, though no consideration for sex or proflie has been featured in the letter, all that follows is a true account of what happened. We have merely copied every word out in full, without omitting any, so that the whole narrative may not, by reason of this censorship, be described as 'anti-tsang', because of the intent to glorify sexual depravity. The story is already copied from above. I heard of this copy-writing from a man who did it for a newsagent at an early stage.","Because what is written above is merely a discussion of love, it is purely factual record, there is no disease of teaching lustful behavior, so I copied it from the beginning to the end, and heard the world's legend.","Everything that appears in this book is genuine. I have merely added the introduction and finale to make it a complete story. The true purpose of all that takes place within these pages is to amuse and none other. I have proceeded from top to bottom, thus giving you an entire drama to read.","In view of the grand principle that it is not about sex, nor merely a record of facts, there is no harm in treating time and love as two sides of the same coin, and writing all over again from beginning to end, so as to hear the legends of the world.","But before he could read on, the old man's attention was caught by a letter which said: 'The Courtment for the present have decided against granting their request. It contains these extracts in its whole essence, free from any symptoms of immorality or politics. It has been compiled from beginning to end. I hear of such stories every generation in annals of legend.'","The main points of the above were just talking about love, it was merely a record of events, there is no disease of inciting time or obscenity, so I copied them from the beginning to the end, hearing world legends.","The reason why I wrote this is simply that it gives a frank account of what has happened, containing no obscene or诲淫 moral lesson. I have copied the whole thing from beginning to end for publication as a single volume of 'My Last Days and Nights'."

这刘老老方安顿了，便说道：“我今日带了你侄儿，不为别的，因他爹娘连吃的没有，天气又冷，只得带了你侄儿奔了你老来。”,"Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again: 'The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and Ma haven't anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder, and – and – I thought I'd bring him here to see you...'","This is how Liu Tong took care of his son, without any other reason.

He said, ""I am bringing you because your uncle is hungry. The weather is cold too.

Therefore, the old mother of the dog has been taken in by them, living together.","This was of old a family of farmers who did well out of hunting and fishing; but now that the two sons had gone off to make a living elsewhere and Mrs Gou-er's duties of cooking and milking had been taken up by their mother-in-law, Gou-er felt there was too much idle time on his part. Accordingly he had brought Grandmother Liu in to help him, so as to be able to live together once more under roof.","A family of four, who make a living from agriculture.

One member of the household was a dog-driver by day who did odd jobs for someone in the neighbourhood; while his two daughters helped to bore corn and other crops. Since Gou-er had left home to seek his own livelihood, Aunt Liu (Grannie Liu) and the two girls had been living entirely at home with no one to look after them besides; so Gou-er took advantage of this lack to bring her there and share their lives.","A family of four, working as farmers. The dog did some work during the day, so that Mr. Liu handled the water jigger and other matters. There was no one to look after the two little sisters, and the dog then took the old mother Cui Xiujiu to live.","Their main business was farming. So on weekends Dog-er made little trades out of time with his flocks and gallows, which Thaydstan and I had been taught to perform, put out the闲置在家的老老寡妇不予照看，却把祖母接到家中过活。","A family of four who were farmers. Because the dog made some money during the day, Liu was also engaged in work such as grinding and milking.

The two elder daughters were already adults and had started to live independently, but Jia Huan, their father, found it impossible to leave them on their own, so he decided to bring Grandmother Liu, their mother-in-law, round to live with them. They set up shop in a small village not far away, where each member of the household had his or her own job."

兄弟和梨洲兄推想，这次‘明史’一案所以如此大张旗鼓，雷厉风行，当是鳌拜意欲挫折我江南士人之气。”,Huang and I are both of the opinion that Oboi is at the back of this Ming History affair.

平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。,"There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.","The night in the Peace Village was full of thoughts, but no one could see the large flower on Ouyang Guo's curtains. It just appeared as a shadow. Many thoughts were buried deep inside, like a layer of sand. They all were laboring for survival, extracting oil, cleaning water, crystallizing it into small pieces, how could they ever rise up?","Realizing how difficult it is to find words to express what he was feeling, Wang Qiyao hung up her curtains, making the large flowers on the window frame look like moss; but many of her insecurities were saved from内在的沉渣般一直淤积在心底,成不了形不成大小。","The nights of Peaceful Life were also full of thoughts, but they could not be revealed because there was no big flowers on Wang Qiuyue's curtains. Many thoughts were sunk deep in her heart, just like old dirt. They were all made by life to endure, squeezed out their juice, dried up their water, solidified into blocks, and how they would shake up was not possible.","But even at night peace has many headcases, and among these cases is the repressed desire that one never gets to see in full bloom over the windows, where it would make for a lovely curtain. These repressed desires sink to the bottom of people's hearts, where they are washed away by the currents of ordinary living. Filled with passion as they are with the necessity of making ends meet, those heartcases have evaporated into a stiff, congealed substance, incapable of bubbling to the surface.",The night of平安里并不是只有王琦瑶窗前的花朵才感到迷茫，只是缺少王琦瑶窗前的大花朵，反而无法显现出来。许多想法都藏在心中，如同沉淀的污垢。全是一起熬过生活的苦痛，将汗水洗净，把水分结晶，化成一块块，怎么也难以激起波澜。,"Realized? Not all of them were. Wang Qiyao's curtains provided a decent backdrop for the flowers, but many of these thoughts were stuck in her heart—a stew of inertia. The simmering arguments she made were condensed into bits that could have been put on hold until needed.","In the night of peace, there were many thoughts too, but they couldn't be seen because the curtains on Wang Qiuyue's window didn't have big flowers like that. Many thoughts lay deep in her heart, like garbage. All of them were made by life, squeezed out their juices, dried up their water, condensed into blocks, and couldn't rise above a certain level of excitement.","Understandably enough, Peace Lane at night offers up quite a picture; only, there is no large flower like the one on Wang Qiyao's curtain, and the flowers have sunk to the bottom so they do not drown out anything. These repressed thoughts float somewhere in the back of people's minds; when life throws everything against them, they squeeze the juice out, drain the water off, forming pictures of varying sizes and texture, but never able to rise above the stagnation.","The night in the平安里 also contained many thoughts, but there was no big flower on the curtains of Wang Guo'er. It was just a reflection of it. Many thoughts were buried in their hearts, as if they were dried up like a dry sponge. They were all about making life tough, boiling down, purifying, condensing into blocks, how could they be touched up?","Realized coming from a distance,平安里是有一个凌晨四点的光景的，但这些光景却笼罩着一切，抑或如一潭深不见底的咸菜色的浮云，心存芥蒂的都都都地咽下了，什么也没溢出。","In the peaceful place there were also many thoughts at night, but they could not be seen because there was no big flowers on Wang Qiaoyue's curtains. Many of these thoughts were buried deep in her heart. They were just like garbage that had been squeezed dry. They all came from hard times and when you squeeze them out, they form a solid block. How can they rise up?","But even at night peace has many thoughts; only that the large flowers against Wang Qiyao's curtains cannot be seen give rise to countless others. These thoughts sink deep into one's heart, like garbage; it is the压力下榨出的精华，凝成的堡块，毫无波澜地。"
这种弄堂的房屋看上去是鳞次栉比，挤挤挨挨，灯光是如豆的一点一点，虽然微弱，却是稠密，一锅粥似的。,"Apartment structures are built virtually on top of one another, cheek by jowl, breathing down upon each other's necks. Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.","The courtyard house looks like a sea of brick, crowded together, with lights that seem like grains of sand. While weak, they were dense; as if a pot of soup.","The apartments of these longtang look like a series of parallel stripes, packed so densely that you have to zoom out to see anything beyond the first few or even the last few slivers. The lamps are clusterred, faintly路灯样的光，一直连成网状，什么事情都难以覆盖。","This kind of courtyard houses look like a row of buildings, crowded together, with dim lights here and there, although they are not bright, they form a dense soup.","The tactics of concealment work better in these longtang where every house looks to be built right next door; where lamps flicker in the darkness, contributing to an enveloping soup of light.","This alley house appears to be a cluster of buildings, crowded together, with lights scattered like grains. Although faintly, they were dense, as if it was a soup pot.","The shells of these longtang buildings look like a mesh of connection—crisscrossing toward each other, they seem to converge onto nothing at times, but however dense the mixture may be, you never can tell until you try.","This alley house looks like a row of slum houses, crowded together, with dim lights that flicker like beans. Though weak, they form a dense mass.","Even so, these Shanghai-style longtang seem to be everywhere crowded; their buildings appear so close one might think they were built in the same batch. Despite the fact that they appear dim and distant, they actually exhibit a dense radiance—a bit of light in a soup of darkness.","This courtyard flat is like a sea of bricks, crowded together, with lamps scattered like grains, although faintly, but dense.","The apartments in these longtang look like a checkerboard of interlacing streets, requiring ample sunlight to spread out evenly.","The houses in this lane look like a row of closely packed huts, with dim lights that flicker here and there, even though they're weak, they're dense and like a pot of soup.","Despite their density, the longtang in the Shanghai of 1945 looked not crowded but spacious; even the flickering lights gave off a feeling of thickness, like a thick soup in which many small ingredients were simmering."

'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.","Then I would not have been surprised if they had not come to disturb me: for my birthday is on the 12th of this month; but how can I know that they did not come here? The length is so long, the texture is so fine, and the flavor is so sweet. There are a large, round fruit; a very big, round country; there are huge, round fish.""","I hope you weren't aware that I was afraid of inviting you to my birthday dinner,' said Shi-Bao. 'I have no reason for expecting you to come, if it be to eat a bunch of ripe fish and a batch of hard candy, or a batch of powdered blue sugar on three, or a lengthwise long like tangrees, or so thick and such large like these Persian oranges as you've brought from Bao-chai's and Mr. Cheng's.","Wang Zhepu said, ""I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been forced. It was on the thirtieth of this month that my birthday was. I didn't know that those two old men had come looking for me. They were so fat, so long, tender, fresh lotus roots; such a big watermelon; they were as long as these elephants' heads and as big as a whole elephant's head. And also there was the incense of the Elephant Country.""","I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't for the fact that it's my birthday,' said Xue Pan. 'I heard they were going to get some fresh coles from Old Hu and Old Cheng. And then I heard they'd brought this big bunch of Thai sugar cane sugar candy, and some of those long, fat Thai pigs and fish.'","Peng Baogang said, ""If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have disturbed you; because this month's birthday is my birthday: How big and how long are these? They're just as hard as a cucumber. A very small and short fresh pear. A huge pineapple, so large that it seems like an elephant. And a giant fish, so enormous that it looks like a lion.""","I hope it's because,' said Xiang Pan, 'that you haven't forgotten me on this occasion. You would find out very soon what your friends have brought you: a big length of lightly spun pure jade-curd cake; a large bunch of long, thin plump pear cakes; a large bunch of the long, long mangoes from where your journeyman baker can find anything at bargain-price; some fragrant sweet corncake; and, above all, two long, tall chillies grown from the fruits of a new Government plantation in Thailand.","Wang Zhepan said: ""I don't dare to disturb it unless I do so. Only because there were two old men here - one named Luo Hou and the other was called Cheng - they came up with this huge piece of fresh lotus root, such a big watermelon, and this giant elephant from Siam.""","I wouldn't have disturbed you if I hadn't been sure of your instant attention! It all starts on the thirteenth. Third Wednesday of the month. Now look: This beautiful fresh coconut pie! And look at the nice firm, ripe coconuts! And look at that lovely big pearl-white ear of暹逻王的 pork, so perfectly shaped and cut! And look at the crystal-clear fish from that far-off country called Thailand! Just wait until the twenty-first! That's the day I give my birthday feast.'","Then I would not have been alarmed at all if it were not for my birthday; because on the 10th of next month is my birthday, and what can we say about our father-in-law and uncle-uncle? This is a large piece of raw ginger, this is a long piece of fresh fruit, this is a big piece of sweet melon; and this is a huge piece of a pineapple; and this is a huge piece of a fish.""","I hope it's because I've got a birthday,' said Bao-yu, 'that you wouldn't want to disturb me; but if there were only one thing on the month's calendar, which is the 3rd day after the New Year, I can imagine that by next week you should have procured from your backyard a root of about two feet thick and two feet long, with at each end ornamental buds, big enough for human hands to hold, and luscious florets of fresh cabbage, and enormous fruits of considerable age and quality supplied by the Chinguanians from Siam as far off as the Thai Islands.","Xuefeng said: ""I wouldn't dare to disturb them if I didn't have to. Only on the thirtieth of this month, is my birthday. I had no idea where they found such big ones. The sweet fresh lotus roots; the huge watermelons; the long silkworms and fish from Siam.""","I wouldn't have bothered if it hadn't been for the day on which they say it is,' said Xue Pan. 'It's Wednesday the third. Now, you know that my birthday falls on that day. You will remember that Uncle Huang and Uncle Cheng haven't got any meat in the house for a long time now. They might not have got any this week if it hadn't been for me! Look at the rough, hardy thing we've got! Look at the fresh, crisp sweetpotatoes the same size as my fist! And look at the big, long coconut curd balls, so cool and fragrant from the Thai Embassy ... just like those nice, kind pigs and fish they send us every year!"

为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。,"In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.","For her, she has not been silent about her grievances, while Mr. Chen's head was on the table as a hundred promises and vows were written for him. Yet, when he joined the state-owned enterprise, his properties became part of the national government, which meant that he had earned a heaven-sent blessing from heaven and earth. The dream of owning a private villa turned into a shadow at the garden apartment.","She didn't mind venting her frustrations, but Mr. Cheng had stricken out a million promises for the state and millions for the private pocket, and now their company was public property and they couldn't look back on their own fortunes—a beautiful garden and splendid apartment in their private mansion would have been worth more than anything.","For this she had often complained, Mr. Yin had made a thousand vows on his pillow, all promises made, but when the public ownership of property was forced upon him, he could not retain even one room, and it was like a dream that the garden house had become a mere illusion.","She got upset enough to make Wang Qiyao swear that if he didn't give up his hobby, he'd offer the entire apartment to her—only to find that at the end of the day, state ownership meant the same thing as state blessing, and even if Madame Yan had won half of the property, it would have been a dead end.","She had complained a lot about Mr. Chen's bedchamber and her promise of everything from heaven to earth, but it was not enough for her to have a private enterprise and all her property were handed over to the state. The only thing that she could keep was a place of private residence.","She didn't mind quarrelling about how Mr. Chen's bed was missed; she'd promised she wouldn't let it continue, but Mr. Cheng himself had decided to combine his private business with public works and sold the whole lot to the State for a sum of money. The result was that he had been able to stay in his private garden and mansion even though the whole place had been acquired by the State for public purposes.","In order to make her mad, he had made a thousand promises and vows on his pillow, but when the public ownership of enterprises was established, all his private property became nationalized. He could only save a small piece of land as a token of gratitude. The garden and villa were finally turned into a mirage.","She got so that, on some occasions, she even heard Mr. Yan complain about her—how would he get rid of the bed, the bedside table, the wardrobe?—and now, upon the advent of state-owned enterprise and the great great purge of personal properties for the benefit of the state, all was well: She had kept a small patch of ground where she could tuck herself in bed at night and cry herself to sleep.","She did not mind her frustration; she was a part of the plan when Mr. Chen put down his head on the floor and made his own vows. He had also promised that he would not let it be, but now he found out that public-private partnerships were taking place, so what could she do? To save one house is like getting heaven and earth, and the garden apartment will become a memory at last.",She made constant complaints about his unwarful disposition; but Madame Yan had already seen enough of him for her life; he was a unfit private citizen who should never have been allowed to run his business. If she could only get the joint partnership of the government between the two firms and turn it into her advantage by planting a lavish mansion in one of the beautiful gardens and building out a large room in another.,"For this she has often complained, Mr. Yin set up a thousand vows on his pillow, and all kinds of vows, but in vain. In the end, the private house was taken by the state, and it could not be saved as a heaven’s grace and earth’s grace, so the garden and villa were all turned into dreams.","She got down to business and, to the dismay of her husband, who promised her the world in his bedtime stories, did everything she could to nationalize their property and preserve a few private rooms. Sadly, that dream too ended in waterloo."

韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。,The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.,"Wu Xiaowang walked up with a strong will, his pain could be endured for what seemed like hours. When he asked蕊初这个问题，他只是觉得全身各处都感到疼痛无比，忍不住哼了一声。","Trinket appeared at Hushaicong's door again, this time with more energy in his bones than ever. 'I can't tell you how much pain I suffered from,' he said to him, feeling every ache in his body, 'but I can tell you that my [she] is asking.","Wu Xiaoya stood up suddenly, her face flushed red. She was wearing a short skirt that barely covered her knees. Her legs were so long, she could even stretch them out and touch her toes. She was a bit embarrassed.","Trinket took another vigorous step forward, but the pain in his limbs was such that he could now withstand anything. When, however, Professor蕊初刺激性地询问了一下他受伤的地方, he felt all through his body as if someone were probing every bone in his frame with a sharp instrument. He was too embarrassed to answer back.","In a burst of strength, Wang Xiaowang walked forward, and his pain was also tolerable. When he asked Budaixin what was wrong with him, she thought that her whole body was painful everywhere. She couldn't help but grumble.","Trinket appeared at Hushyu's door again, this time with pain in his eyes, and in a way he could understand: the pain in his body was unceasing, and Trinket could almost cry out softly.",Wu Xiaoya was forced to walk with her body feeling as if it was made of iron. She could not help but groan in pain.,"Trinket took a different approach. He kept up the pressure for himself, and when蕊初问他有没有痛处时，她又给了他那个他听得出但并不知道是什么回答。","With his heart pounding, he came out again, but his pain could endure for a while, and when he asked Lu Xiu, who was so curious, she felt her body ache everywhere, which made her sigh.","Trinket appeared again, this time with a pain in his arm. The pain in her request caused him to laugh out loud. 'I can't tell you how bad it hurts, Her茎上,' he said, gradually relishing it. 'I've got such unbearable pain in my whole body that I don't know where to look.'","Wu Xiaolei walked towards him with all his strength, and his pain was also tolerable, but he felt that every part of his body hurt, so he couldn’t help moaning.","Trinket resumed his march, though with a slightly different attitude. He could now endure the pain in his legs and arms, which had seemed insurmountable a few moments earlier, thanks to Blossom's question; but the movement of riding out such a storm of humiliation caused him to moan."
看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。,"Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","I was thinking of something pleasant inside my heart. There was a little bit of desire in my mind. I also had some fondness for them. They were standing far away from me, but they couldn’t hear what was going on there. They were lying down in one position, sitting up in another position, and then leaning forward and then turning around. Then, she was laying half way between the two sides, with her head hanging over the ground. She was wearing a thin sleepwear that covered her body, which had been torn by the bed. The bed was slightly wrinkled, too.","But her curiosity was piqued, even though she had little desire for this new discovery. Because they were far from where and because the women weren't listening to the noise around them, the women in the dark couldn't hear what was going on; but a woman in a bed-suit of that sort lying on her side appeared at one moment with its head tilted up, another with its body hanging over the edge of the bed, and another with his half-conscious figure above the rim of the bed, also hanging almost to the floor. There was a hint of rigidity in the translucent sleepers as their bodies changed positions. The wrinkles on the walls were beginning to irritate the amateur restorer of underwear.","She seemed pleased with her own appearance, but also a little bored by it. She was standing far enough away from them not to hear what they were saying, but she could see that there was a woman lying on her bed, in different positions: some of which involved lying on one side, others on her back, while one leg was extended out onto the floor. Her dress was transparent, so she looked like a ghost. The bed was already wrinkled, so she didn't look very clean.","But though they were happy with their arrangement, this girl was a bit frustrated. They stood far away so that they could hear nothing of the going on in the bedroom; they could see, however, the woman lying back on the bed, her several positions, the one at least half sitting up, the other half hanging to the side of the bed, her transparent robe curling around her body, the bed already looking worn out.","I have a little smile on my face. And I am still thinking about it. There is something strange in their eyes. They are standing far away from me, but they can't hear what is said there. The woman who was lying on the bed with a sleepcoat over her had a shape of a woman sleeping. She was sitting in different positions. The first one was side-to-side, and the second one was looking up at the ceiling. Then she lay half of her body on the floor. The other half was hanging off the ground. Her sleepwear was covering her body, the bed was wrinkled. It's also somewhat sticky.","But her curiosity about their conversation—though she was still some distance from where they were—had begun to tango—and there was so much about the床上的人—women of various ages and descriptions, wearing warm garments for different purposes—whose faces she could not see, standing with their heads bent, a full body raised up on one's bedside, the damp corners of which she could feel—it seemed to have a slightly toying quality that reminded her of a cloth罩着自己的身体，也使她对其中某物的一份心绪有一点发腻。","She felt a bit of happiness as well as some lust for them standing far away. She could not hear what was said there because they were too far from her. She saw that there was a woman wearing a sleep robe lying on her bed. She lay down in different positions – side to side, back to front, and even half way down. Her transparent robe covered her body. The bed had already wrinkled.","But as they stood off a bit, it started to feel a bit monotonous; besides, they couldn't hear what they were talking about, since all the voices merged together into one sound. They could only make out a woman's voice talking to herself as she lay in bed, and the other women acted out various positions: front, side, back. One had the woman lying on her side; another had her on her back; and yet another had just occupied half of the bed while the other half dangled to the floor. Her sleep mask completely covered her body, which was visible through the half-transparent coverlet. The bed was creased, and the whole scene was a bit boring.","I am thinking of her heart a little too much, and there is something on my tongue that I cannot help but feel. They stand so far away from me, and they can't hear what's going on around them, just as one woman sits on the bed with a shawl over her head, and she changed positions every time, for example, when she was lying sideways, or standing up and looking at the ceiling, or even when she was half way down on the floor. She had a thin sleeping robe covering her body, the bed was already sagging, which reminded me of how old it was.","She had a touch of anticipation as she noted their distance from the fire - otherwise they were silent; nevertheless, she could still feel the whispers of something behind them, like the whispers of women in the dark. One of them lay on her side, the other on her back, then another, taller one, who lay face-up on the ground—his half-open sleeperscape was not without a tinge of remindme of suffusion. Another among them laid his half-clothed shirt, which had been sitting on the floor for some time, gave a sign of being old and start-sucking by the time he reached mid-bed. The stiffen in the translucent garment reminded her of interest.","The passage is a description of some women who are sitting on a bed. The woman sitting closest to the reader appears to be in her 30s or 40s. She has short hair that she braids into two long strands. Her eyes are closed and she is sleeping peacefully. She is wearing a white dress with black lace around the edges. She looks very elegant. She is lying down on her back, but it's not flat, as there are small bumps all over her body. Her head is slightly turned to one side, so you can see her face. Her hands are crossed behind her neck, and her legs are spread out. She is wearing a pair of black slippers, which are tied together at the toes.","But this time the host had taken the initiative and moved closer; they could now hear what they were discussing—perhaps a young woman complaining about her boss, perhaps a man complaining about his wife. The women sat close together, one leaning rightward, the other leeward, one sitting up, the other lying back, but it was starting to feel monotonous as they did the same movements over and over."
