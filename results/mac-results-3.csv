So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.","Even though she was now pregnant, Grandma had been high schooler at the time. Since that moment she had entered into a love affair with my crime, both tragic and gloriously extravagant. For that matter, she had been the bride of the Zhang family, the maiden-in-waitting of my marriage, and therefore, since my father had not yet set foot on land, we called her Remi's little girl. More importantly than that, the topic of discussion about those days was never referred to as Yu Zhan'ao: it remained purely arbitrary. And finally, even my father, who had not yet left the fork of the mountain, could hardly be called随意的，因为他的存在只能从外人看来。","Although my grandmother was at peace with him among the millet fields, in that solemn process of cohabitation marked by pain and happiness, although she was also carrying half a load of my sins and virtues, after all, she was still the father of the Fengjia County, the noble bride of the Northern Plains, but then, my grandmother was only the single housewife who was married by arrangement; her husband and she were more or less free and accidental. Moreover, my father hadn't yet fallen into the ground, so when I wrote about those events, I still called him Yu Quanliao more accurately.","Even though Great-Grandma had consummated her love for Father in the sorghum field, and although she had, with half pain, half pleasure, become a clear-cut marriage partner of the single Wang clan head, it was still Father who fathered my current existence, even though he hadn't quite lost his footing in society. So when I came to write about this time in his life, I continued to refer to him as Yu Zhan'ao. He was still a very effective name.","Although my grandmother had already achieved a harmonious union with him amidst the millet fields, birthing my half-glorious, half-cursed father, who was a notable figure in the northeast region of Gaomi, when she was still the officially married wife of Uncle, their union was marked by a certain degree of pain intertwined with happiness.

'Don't you worry, Grannie!","By this time on her way there all expectations for the contents of the letter had vanished.

It was because her husband had acquired the land by buying it back from his father-in-law several years ago, that he had received help from a dog who had once been his father-in-law’s helper. Seeing Liu Lao-Lao like this, he couldn’t resist his desire; secondly, he wanted to show off his face. He said, ""Old old, you can rest assured.""","By the time Zhou Rui's wife had finished listening, she had fairly guessed the purpose of their visit. But it was a pity that her husband should have waited until now to tell him how much money they had finally spent on the farm. It was a just补偿， for his father had done so much to win over Grannie Liu's hostelmasters by buying land for them. Moreover, he thought it only fair that they should show off their largesse before him. So with a smile on her face, she went on: 'Trusty Grannie, don't you worry!","Zhou Rui's family, upon hearing this, already guessed the purpose of the visit. It was due to her husband's past struggle to purchase land, where he received considerable assistance from Dog Er's father, that she found it difficult to refuse the old lady's intentions now.

She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.","The sight of them standing outside the curtain made its way inside her heart a little, even though all she could see was the direction in which they were lying. They were a couplee, on their side, with a bed already set up; another was on her back, stretched out on her hands and knees; and a third, one of the women guessed, had somehow rearranged herself so that her body was tilted towards the headboard and that she was lying on her back with her legs over the edge of the room—a single sheet covering nothing but her shoulders.

The one woman, wearing a transparent nightie, lay on her side; the other, on her back; and another, only the top half of her body was exposed, her legs dangling off the side of the bed. The thin, translucent nightie added nothing to her elegance; the bed was pitted with wrinkles, and the scene was a little disgusting.","The sight stirred a mix of pleasure and disgust within me. They were positioned at a distance, so they couldn't hear what was being said there. I could only see a woman in a negligee lying on a bed, changing positions several times. One moment she was lying on her side, then facing upwards, and another time, she was only half lying down with the other half hanging off the ground.
