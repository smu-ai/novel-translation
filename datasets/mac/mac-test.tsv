钱老板道：“是，是，多谢香主。” 在一张椅上坐了，续道：“属下将小郡主藏在猪肚里带进宫来，一来是为瞒过宫门侍卫的重重搜检，二来是要瞒过沐王府众人的耳目。	'Thank you, Master,' said Butcher Qian, seating himself in one of the chairs and continuing.

But it was also to get her past any of the Mu Family spies who might be out watching for us.

海老公问起今日做了什么事，韦小宝说了到鳌拜家中抄家，至于吞没珍宝、金银、匕首等事，自然绝口不提，最后道：“太后命我到鳌拜家里拿两部《四十二章经》……”	When Old Hai asked what he had been doing that day, Trinket told him that he had been helping supervise the confiscation of Oboi's estate. He concluded his account—which of course omitted any mention of the dagger and various other valuables that he had pocketed for himself—by telling him about the two copies of the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections that had been discovered in Oboi's house.

钱老板接了过来，在猪背上一划，没料到这匕首锋利无匹，割猪肉如切豆腐，一剑下去，直没至柄。	Butcher Qian took it from him and made an incision in the back of the pig's carcass.

夫妻二人半世只生此女，一旦失去，何等烦恼，因此昼夜啼哭，几乎不顾性命。 看看一月，士隐已先得病，夫人封氏也因思女构疾，日日请医问卦。	The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the one daughter can be imagined.

皇帝和大官都很残忍，心里不喜欢谁，就说他犯了罪，把他放在鼎里活活煮熟。	Those ancient Emperors and great ministers were very cruel. If they didn't like somebody, they would pretend that they had committed some crime or other, and then they would put them in a cauldron and boil them.

王琦瑶到家后，她母亲已炖了鸡汤和红枣桂圆汤，什么话也没有地端给她喝，也不看那孩子一眼，就当没这个人似的。	When Wang Qiyao came home the next day, her mother had already prepared a pot of chicken broth and the customary bowl of soup with red jujube and longan, which was supposed to be so nourishing for new mothers.

She could not, however, forbear a few rebellious mutterings: 'Huh! One of the masters! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers! Even I should be ashamed!
她要讨论的事是这祥的：虽然所有的人都说她是一个破鞋，但她以为自己不是的。	The issue she wanted to discuss was this: Despite the fact that everyone believed she was damaged goods, she didn't think she was.

那婆娘是个寡妇，泼得厉害。	The woman was a widow, a real bitch.
陈清扬说，我始终是一个恶棍。	Chen Qingyang told me later that I had always been a scoundrel.
任副官在他腚上打了一鞭子，他嘴咧开叫一声：孩子他娘！	Adjutant Ren smacked him across the backside with his whip, forcing a yelp from between his parted lips. Ouch, mother of my children!
只听一路靴子响，进来了一个十七八岁的少年，面目清秀，身段苗条，美服华冠，轻裘宝带。	A man's footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced, willowy youth of seventeen or eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room.

但来自附中的四位小将自有她们“无坚不摧”的革命方式，刚才动手的那个女孩儿又狠抽了叶哲泰一皮带，另外三个女孩子也都分别抡起皮带抽了一下，当同伴革命时，她们必须表现得更革命，至少要同样革命。	But the four junior high girls had their own revolutionary methods that they believed were invincible. The girl who had hit Ye before took out her belt and whipped Ye again. The other three girls also took off their belts to strike at Ye.

它们还像是大河一般有着无数的支流，又像是大树一样，枝枝杈杈数也数不清。	Like a great river, these longtang have innumerable tributaries, and their countless branches resemble those of a tall tree.

走出深山，叶文洁充满了春天的感觉，“文革”的严冬确实结束了，一切都在复苏之中。	Leaving the mountains, Ye felt spring was everywhere. The cold winter of the Cultural Revolution really was over, and everything was springing back to life.
老子要宰了你！	I'll goddamn kill you!
一是我在慰问团面前说出了曾经被打晕的事，叫军代表很没面子；二是争风吃醋，所以他一直修理我。	Firstly, I told the relief delegation that I had been beaten unconscious, which made the military deputy lose face; secondly, he and I fought over a woman, which was why he was always trying to screw me.

理发师正整理她的鬓发，手指触在脸颊，是最悉心的呵护。 她微微侧过脸，躲着吹风机的热风，这略带娇憨的姿态也是昨天的。	As the stylist gave her hair a last-minute adjustment with a hand blower, the expression on Wang Qiyao's face, turning slightly to avoid the hot air with just a soupçon of the spoiled child, belonged to yesteryear.
韦小宝心想：“这肥猪肚中定是藏着什么古怪物事，莫非是兵器之类，天地会想在皇宫中杀人大闹？” 不由得心中怦怦而跳。	It was obvious that something very out of the ordinary must be concealed inside. Trinket could feel his heart thumping as he reflected that this might well be weapons which the Triads were smuggling in to be used in a killing spree inside the Palace.
他们在批斗会上常常进入半睡眠状态，只有一声恫吓才能使其惊醒过来，机械地重复那已说过无数遍的认罪词。	They often seemed to be half asleep during the sessions and would only startle awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.
韦小宝听他接连提到皇上，心念一动：“难道这里是皇宫？	Something was beginning to fall into place in Trinket's mind, with all these references to 'His Majesty'. 'Could this be the Palace, the Forbidden City itself!' he thought silently to himself.

我想帮她一把，也没帮上。	I wanted to help her, but I couldn't.
我后来又见到陈清扬，和她在饭店里登记了房间，然后一起到房间里去，我伸手帮她脱下大衣。	Later I saw Chen Qingyang again. We registered for a room at a hotel, went in together, and then I helped her take off her coat.

——可别冒撞了！”	But mind you don't run into anybody.'
“呵呵，大家来得真早！”	'Haha, everyone got here early!'
李嬷嬷站住，将手一拍，道：“你说，好好儿的，又看上了那个什么‘云哥儿’‘雨哥儿’的，这会子逼着我叫了他来。	Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand: 'What do you think, my dear: His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-planting — 'Yin' or 'Yun' or whatever his name is — so Nannie has to go and ask him in.
他问：什么事啊？	'What is it?'
还有那一次谋杀……	And those murders ...
又叫道：“周大妈，有个老奶奶子找你呢。”	Then, bawling over the wall, 'Mrs Zhou, there's an old woman come to see you!'

罗小四等人回到队里，发现我的东西都不见了，就去问队长可见过王二。	Luo Xiaosi came back to the fourteenth team and found my stuff gone, so he went to ask the team leader whether he had seen me.
她叫我晚上再来这里，我们再试一遍。	She told me to return that evening, and we'd try it one more time.
家人见他这般光景，问：“是怎么了？” 少不得撒谎说：“天黑了，失脚掉在茅厕里了。”	When the servant who answered the gate saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened, he had to pretend that he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes.
没有比流言更能胡编乱造，信口雌黄的了。	No one is better at making up stories, telling lies, and wagging its tongue than gossip.
左手在桌上轻轻一拍，道：“定当如此！	He tapped the table lightly with his left hand and continued speaking, apparently to himself. 'Yes, of course. This is obviously the solution.

商店里有一个售货员在打瞌睡，还有很多苍蝇在飞。	Inside one store a saleswoman dozed while a swarm of flies circled around.
她指了屋角，说那里有她的一杯茶，不必了。	She pointed to the corner and said that she already had a cup of tea, so there was no need.
他记挂着扔在围子上的粪筐和粪铲，不由自主地往后歪头，一柄雪亮的刺刀从他的腮帮子旁边欻啦顺过来。	Concerned about the dung basket he'd left on the wall, Pocky Cheng instinctively cocked his head in that direction. A bayonet that shone like snow flashed past his cheek.
她掀起轿帘，看着那个吃拤饼的人。	She raised the curtain to get a glimpse of the man who ate fistcakes.
你难道就知道你的心，不知道我的心不成？”	Do you mean to tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still don't know what my feelings are about you?'
轿子起行，忽悠悠似腾云驾雾，偷懒的吹鼓手在出村不远处就停止了吹奏，轿夫们的脚下也快起来。	Off they went, floating along as though riding the clouds or sailing through a mist. Shortly after leaving the village, the lazy musicians stopped playing, while the bearers quickened their pace.
黄宗羲道：“是啊。	'Quite,' said Huang.
然后他们到一间为游客开的通宵酒吧中去坐了两个多小时，沙瑞山一杯接着一杯地灌啤酒，变得更加健谈，而汪淼却早已心神不定，脑子里不断地浮现出那条绿色直线。	Then they went to an all-night bar for tourists and sat for two hours. As Sha finished one beer after another, his tongue loosened even more. But Wang became anxious, and his mind kept returning to that green line on the terminal in Sha's office.
雨水把奶奶的衣服也打湿了，她本来可以挂上轿帘遮挡雨水，她没有挂，她不想挂，奶奶通过敞亮的轿门，看到了纷乱不安的宏大世界。	Her clothes, too, were soaked. She could have covered herself with the curtain, but she didn't; she didn't want to, for the open front of the sedan chair afforded her a glimpse of the outside world in all its turbulence and beauty.
那东西一听别人谈到它，就激昂起来，蠢动个不停。	As soon as the thing heard people talking about him, he became excited and began to stir.
这一条，你能办到么？”	Do you think you are capable of keeping that rule?'
多么丑恶的东西，我上半生一直在用文学这把解剖刀来揭露这种丑恶，现在连这种揭露都厌倦了。	'The human race is hideous. I've spent the first half of my life unveiling this ugliness with the scalpel of literature, but now I'm even sick of the work of dissection.
虽然我奶奶与他已经在高粱地里凤凰和谐，在那个半是痛苦半是幸福的庄严过程中，我奶奶虽然也怀上了我的功罪参半但毕竟是高密东北乡一代风流的父亲，但那时奶奶是单家的明媒正娶的媳妇，爷爷与她总归是桑间濮上之合，带着相当程度的随意性偶然性不稳定性，况且我父亲也没落土，所以，写到那时候的事，我还是称呼他余占鳌更为准确。	Even though by then he and Grandma had already done the phoenix dance in the sorghum field, and even though, in the solemn course of suffering and joy, she had conceived my father, whose life was a mixture of achievements and sin (in the final analysis, he gained distinction among his generation of citizens of Northeast Gaomi Township), she had nonetheless been legally married into the Shan family. So she and Granddad were adulterers, their relationship marked by measures of spontaneity, chance, and uncertainty. And since Father wasn't born while they were together, accuracy demands that I refer to Granddad as Yu Zhan'ao in writing about this period.
他甚是得意，说道：“嗯，右脸刻一堆牛粪，可没人出钱来买牛粪的，不如刻只猪，又肥又蠢，生意一定好。”	This gave him great satisfaction and inspired him to further idiocy. 'Hm, a cow-pat on the right cheek—no, I don't think anyone's going to pay good money for that. A fat pig would be better—a great big, fat, stupid-looking pig. That would sell.'

凤姐笑道：“像你这样的人能有几个呢，十个里也挑不出一个来！”	'But how many men are there like you?' said Xi-feng. 'I doubt you could find one in ten.'
“哈，我觉得那是最不真实的！” IT副总裁说，“我用公司的上百名员工进行过一个简单的测试，即使这想法真能实现，人列计算机的运算速度可能比一个人的手工计算都慢。”	'Ha! I thought that was the most unrealistic aspect,' the software company vice president said. 'I conducted a test with more than a hundred employees at my company. Even if the idea worked, a computer made of people would probably operate at a speed slower than manual computation.'
奶奶撕下轿帘，塞到轿子角落里，她呼吸着自由的空气，看着余占鳌的宽肩细腰。	Grandma ripped the curtain from the front of the carriage and stuffed it behind the seat. As she breathed the free air she studied Yu Zhan'ao's broad shoulders and narrow waist.
道路两边，板块般的高粱坚固凝滞，连成一体，拥拥挤挤，彼此打量，灰绿色的高粱穗子睡眼未开，这一穗与那一穗根本无法区别，高粱永无尽头，仿佛潺潺流动的河流。	Barriers of sorghum stalks lining the path stood erect and solid in unbroken rows, tightly packed, together sizing one another up with the yet unopened clay-green eyes of grain ears, one indistinguishable from the next, as far as she could see, like a vast river.
可巧凤姐正在上房算了输赢帐，听见后面一片声嚷，便知是李嬷嬷老病发了，又值他今儿输了钱，迁怒于人，排揎宝玉的丫头。	Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia's room totting up the day's scores for the final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment. She identified it immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more, taking out on Bao-yu's unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses.
家中虽不甚富贵，然本地也推他为望族了。	The household was not a particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry as the leading family in the neighbourhood.
要好的只好等袭人来。”	If nothing but the best will do, you'd better wait for Aroma to come.'
就因为这个原因，我对自己存不存在的事不太关心。	So I didn't really care whether I existed or not.
东北乡地势低洼，往往秋水泛滥，高粱高秆防涝，被广泛种植，年年丰产。	Northeast Gaomi Township is largely swampy land that is flooded by autumn rains; but since the tall sorghum stalks resist waterlogging, it was planted everywhere and invariably produced a bumper crop.
刘老老心中想着：“这是什么东西? 有煞用处呢？”	'I wonder what that can be,' she thought to herself, 'and what it can be used for?'
要说明她怎会有这种见识，一切都要回溯到那一回我从医院回来，从她那里经过进了山。	To explain how she came to this realization, we need to go all the way back to the time I returned from the hospital and left for the mountains from her place.
那男孩哼了一声，倒退几步。	The boy groaned and staggered back a few steps.

这个玩具盒般的宇宙令她感到分外舒适，渐渐地这宇宙由想象变成了梦乡。	This toy-box-like universe comforted Ye, and gradually it shifted from her imagination into her dreams.
想着，便将正面一照，只见凤姐站在里面点手儿叫他。 贾瑞心中一喜，荡悠悠觉得进了镜子，与凤姐云雨一番，凤姐仍送他出来。	He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again.
他恨我毒瞎了他眼睛，因此想尽办法来害我。	'He hated me because I made him blind, so he did everything in his power to harm me.
她说自己要遭报应时，一道红晕正从她的胸口褪去。	When she said that, the band of flush was fading from her chest.
整个事情就是这样的。	That was how the whole business went.
我这份交待材料不少人要看，假如他们看了情不自禁，也去搞破鞋，那倒不伤大雅，要是学会了这个，那可不大好。	Many people would read my confessions. If after reading them they couldn't help screwing damaged goods, that wasn't so bad; but if they learned the other thing, that would be really bad.
常伟思拍拍桌子说，“不要扯远了，你可以说出自己的方案。”	General Chang slammed the table. 'Don't bring up irrelevant matters. If you have a plan, say what it is.'
我没情没绪地过了一段时间，自己回了内地。	I lived a listless existence for a while and went back to the interior alone.
“目标距琴一公里！”	'Target is one kilometer from the zither.'
它压倒了薄荷的幽香，压倒了高粱的甘苦，它唤醒了父亲那越来越迫近的记忆，一线穿珠般地把墨水河淤泥、把高粱下黑土、把永远死不了的过去和永远留不住的现在联系在一起，有时候，万物都会吐出人血的味道。	It overwhelmed the smell of peppermint and the pungent sweetness of sorghum and awakened in Father's mind a memory that drew ever nearer: like beads, it strung together the mud of the Black Water River, the black earth beneath the sorghum, the eternally living past, and the unstoppable present. There are times when everything on earth spits out the stench of human blood.
在山上敦伟大友谊时，嘴里喷出白气。	While we were strengthening our great friendship on the mountain, white breath puffed from our mouths.
“叶老师，您不知道吗？ 外头高考了！” 那女孩儿兴高采烈地说。	'Teacher Ye, don't you know that they've restarted the exam?' the girl said excitedly.
海老公道：“只有个老娘。	'Only a mother,' said the old eunuch.
年纪大了，陈清扬变得有点敏感。	An older woman now, Chen Qingyang had become more sensitive.
她的脸更红了，说道：王二，你一辈子学不了好，永远是个混蛋。	The color in her face deepened. She said, Wang Er, you'll never learn how to be good. You'll always be a bastard!
他就到门口去喊人，叫过路的大嫂站住。	So he went outside to call someone. He ordered a few passing women to stop.
海老公道：“不过怎么？”	'You what?' snapped the eunuch.
两人又回到方才那棚里，不料人都散了，那床也挪开了，剩几个人在地上收拾东西。	The two returned to the first set only to discover that everyone had gone. Even the bed had been taken away, leaving only a few workers behind to straighten up the remaining items on set.

韦小宝伸出了舌头，半天缩不进去，随即喜欢得心痒难搔，笑道：“我一定不做坏事。	Trinket stuck his tongue out in amazement and it was some time before he could put it back in again. Yet his overriding feeling was not of amazement but of happiness that he had got this heroic strong man for his teacher. 'I promise you I won't ever do anything bad,' he said.
其实在一般女学生看来，能为导演看上去试一回，已是足够的光荣，成功则是奢望中的奢望。	Actually, just to be chosen by a director for a screen test would already have been a great honor in the eyes of most girls—any hopes of getting a part would be a long shot in a long shot.

他心里很安宁，看着窗帘上的光影，什么都不去想的。	He felt utterly at peace as he watched the moonlight dancing on the curtain; he decided to let his mind go blank and not worry about anything that had happened that night.
这件事有两种可能的原因，一是他下来视察，遇见了我对他装聋作哑，因而大怒，不走了。 二是他不是下来视察，而是听说陈清扬和我有了一腿，特地来找我的麻烦。	His visit could be accounted for in two ways: one was that he came down to our team for the investigation, but when he met someone like me who played dumb with him, he got pissed off and decided to stay; the other was that he came down to our team not for investigation, but to pick on me, after hearing that Chen Qingyang and I had a love affair.

惯养娇生笑你痴，菱花空对雪澌澌。	'Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so— That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow!
他们杀人越货，精忠报国，他们演出过一幕幕英勇悲壮的舞剧，使我们这些活着的不肖子孙相形见绌，在进步的同时，我真切地感到种的退化。	They killed, they looted, and they defended their country in a valiant, stirring ballet that makes us unfilial descendants who now occupy the land pale by comparison. Surrounded by progress, I feel a nagging sense of our species' regression.
汪淼现在意识到，《三体》的玩家，可能相当一部分是他们这样的社会精英。	Wang now realized that a considerable number of Three Body players were probably social elites like them.
海老公道：“哼，掀住肩头有什么用？	'That's no good!
我就静静的躺一躺也好啊。”	I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my own.'
钱老板道：“这是沐王府的郡主。”	'She's the Little Countess,' said Butcher Qian. The Mu Family's Little Countess.'
韦小宝应了，走进房中，只见桌上放着碗筷，四菜一汤，没人动过，忙道：“公公，你不吃饭？	'Yes, Goong-goong!' Trinket walked across to the dining-table, where bowls and chopsticks had been laid, four dishes and a soup, all untouched. 'Goong-goong, aren't you eating?

薛蟠忙道：“好兄弟，我原为求你快些出来，就忘了忌讳这句话，改日你要哄我，也说我父亲，就完了。”	'Now look here, old chap,' said Xue Pan, getting agitated, 'it was only because I wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free with your Parent, but after all, you've only got to mention my father next time you want to fool me and we'll be quits!'

怪没意思的。	'Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull.
这是真实发生了的事。	That was what really happened.
父亲早就知道余司令的队伍连聋带哑连瘸带拐不过四十人，但这些人住在村里时，搅得鸡飞狗跳，仿佛满村是兵。	Father knew all along that Commander Yu's troops numbered no more than forty – deaf, mute, and crippled included. But when they were quartered in the village, they had stirred things up so much, with chickens squawking and dogs yelping, that you'd have thought it was a garrison command.
就在这儿谈罢。	Then let's talk.
海老公道：“这小娃娃叫什么名字？	'What was the little fellow's name?
空空道人听如此说，思忖半晌，将这《石头记》再检阅一遍。	For a long time Vanitas stood lost in thought, pondering this speech. He then subjected the Story of the stone to a careful second reading.
“很好，”潘寒说着，转向了IT经理和国电公司领导，“你们二位，已经不适合这场聚会了，也不适合继续玩《三体》游戏。	'Very good,' Pan said. He turned to the software company vice president and the power company executive. 'The two of you are no longer welcome at this meet-up, and you are no longer appropriate players for Three Body.
他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得风度翩翩，“你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士，《三体》就是为你们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。”	Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes.

筒子那么粗，又是两个管，我拿了它很能唬人。	The barrel was so heavy, plus there were two. I could really scare people off with it.
叶文洁推开阮雯的家门，发现抄家后混乱的房间变得整洁了，那几幅被撕的油画又贴糊好挂在墙上，歪倒的钢琴也端正地立在原位，虽然已被砸坏不能弹了，但还是擦得很干净，残存的几本精装书籍也被整齐地放回书架上……	Wenjie pushed open the door to Ruan's home, and she saw that the chaos left by the Red Guards had been cleaned up: The torn oil paintings had been glued back together and rehung on the walls; the toppled piano had been set upright and wiped clean, though it was broken and could no longer be played; the few books left behind had been put back neatly on the shelf....
小舅子，谁开的枪？”	'Who's the prick who did it?'
当下将茅十八抬了进去。	Whiskers was carried through an inner door for his interview.

谁知狗儿利名心重，听如此说，心下便有些活动； 又听他妻子这番话，便笑道：“老老既这么说，况且当日你又见过这姑太太一次，为什么不你老人家明日就去走一遭，先试试风头儿去？”	Gou-er's cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law, and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife's. 'Well, if it's as you say, Grannie, and being as you've already seen this lady, why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?'
两名使者在马上接过担架，双骑相并，缓缓而行。	Two of the mounted men took charge of Whiskers, supporting the ends of the carrying-pole from which his hammock was suspended on their saddle-bows and riding along in parallel very slowly and carefully.
小红闻听，在窗眼内望外一看，原来是本院的个小丫头佳蕙，因答说：“在家里呢，你进来罢。”	Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself. 'Yes, I'm in,' she said. 'Come inside!'
等我来再走。”	You can go when I come for you.'
我和陈清扬在饭店里敦伟大友谊，是娱乐性的。	The strengthening of our great friendship that Chen Qingyang and I did while in the hotel room was of the recreational sort.
贾蔷翻身出来，纸笔现成，拿来叫贾瑞写。 他两个做好做歹，只写了五十两银子，画了押，贾蔷收起来。 然后撕掳贾蓉。	Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his dictation Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong.
别人热闹的时候，他大多是靠边站，有他没他都行的。	When everyone else was having a great time, he would be off standing in one corner as if he did not count.
他隐秘之事甚多，没要小太监住在屋里服侍。	He had too many secrets to want a young eunuch attendant living with him in his apartment.
八月深秋，无边无际的高粱红成洸洋的血海，高粱高密辉煌，高粱凄婉可人，高粱爱情激荡。	In late autumn, during the eighth lunar month, vast stretches of red sorghum shimmered like a sea of blood. Tall and dense, it reeked of glory; cold and graceful, it promised enchantment; passionate and loving, it was tumultuous.
过了一些时候，我们队的知青全调走了。 男的调到糖厂当工人，女的到农中去当老师。	After a while, the city students in our team were all transferred to other positions; the men landed work at the candy factory, and the women got to teach at the agricultural middle school.
“在，大叔，长得好好的，就是耳朵流血啦。”	'It's there, Uncle, right where it's supposed to be. Except your ear's bleeding.'
韦小宝道：“我想也没什么难处，我明天一定牢牢掀住他肩头。”	'I didn't think it would be hard. I just get him in a good shoulder grip, then—'
尽管村子里火光冲天，但高粱地里，还是呈现出一派安恬的宁静夜色。	Although battle fires still lit up the sky above the village, an aura of peace and quiet had settled over the sorghum fields.
那鱼、猪不过贵而难得，这藕和瓜亏他怎么种出来的!	Maybe not so much the sturgeon and the sucking-pig. They're just expensive. But where would you go to get a piece of lotus root or a melon like that? However did they get them to grow so big?
那片地真肥。	That piece of land was really rich.
左首一人又高又瘦，面目黝黑，姓顾名炎武，字亭林，江苏昆山人士。	The other one, a tall, thin man with a swarthy complexion, was Gu Yanwu, a native of Kunshan in Jiangsu Province.
这些人嘴里尊称自己是香主，满口什么静候香主吩咐云云，其实各人肚里早就有了主意，只盼得到自己赞同，于是一切便推在韦香主头上，日后他们就不会担当重大干系。	It was all 'Master this' and 'Master that' and respectfully waiting to be told by the Master what they should do; but invariably they had already decided what they wanted to do and only wanted the Master's approval for doing it, so that if there was any question about it later, the Master would have sole responsibility for what they had done.
我说我不是真去洗温泉，而是到后面山上住几天。	I said I wasn't really going to the thermal springs. I just wanted to stay on the back slope of the mountain for a few days.
彼此的梦里都做过无数回，那梦里的人都不大像了，还不如不梦见。	They had appeared in each other's dreams, but the images in their dreams were so far from the real person that they would have been better off not even dreaming.
唉，也不知我茅十八这一生一世，有没福份见他老人家一面。”	He sighed wistfully. 'I wonder if it will be my luck to see him before I die.'
谁叫王二？	Who's Wang Er?
所以她就决定，早晚要打我一个耳光。	So she decided she was going to slap me sooner or later.
那男孩使出摔交手法，抓住了韦小宝后领，把他重重往地下一摔。	The boy now used a standard wrestling ploy, gripping Trinket by the back of the neck and pulling him to the ground with considerable force.
畜牲，老畜牲！	You bastard, you old bastard!
走出岗亭后，叶文洁听到他对学生们说：“娃娃们，科学家，这可是正儿八经的科学家啊！”	After they left the gatehouse, Ye heard him say to the students: 'Children, that was a scientist. A real, bona fide scientist!'
程先生上班去了，就只这老少三个女人，互诉着生产的苦情。	With Mr. Cheng away at work, these three women of different generations compared notes about the hardships of childbirth.
茅大哥不知能不能逃出皇宫去？	'I wonder if Whiskers got out safe?
要的也不过分，不是地老天荒的一种，只是五十年的流萤。	That's not too much to ask, is it? He didn't ask for an eternity, only the last fifty years.
我成了替爷们解闷儿的了。”	I am to become a source of entertainment for the menfolk now, it seems.'
尤其到了圣诞节，圣诞歌一唱，你真分不清是中国还是外国。	This is especially so around Christmas time: as soon as the Christmas carols break out, you are hard pressed to discern whether you are in China or abroad.
劫路人一声惨叫，半截吐出口外，半截咽到肚里，血从他鼻子里流出来。	The man shrieked in pain; blood trickled from his nose.
因为这些事我无从想象，所以是我存在的证明。	Since I couldn't imagine these things, they must be evidence of my existence.
韦小宝不知“羚羊挂角”是什么手法，误打误撞的胜了一招，大为得意，说道：“这‘羚羊挂角’算得什么，我还有许多厉害手法没使出来呢。”	Trinket had never even heard of the Antelope. He'd just been improvising and thrashing around, and somehow or other had managed to outwit his opponent. He was pretty chuffed. 'The Antelope is nothing!' he cried. 'I know plenty more, and they're a lot worse. You haven't seen anything yet!'
我和陈清扬在蓝粘土上，闭上眼睛，好像两只海豚在海里游动。	When Chen Qingyang and I lay on the blue clay with our eyes closed, we felt like a pair of dolphins swimming in the sea.
晚村兄要是有意，咱三人结伴同去扬州，兄弟给你引见几位同道中人如何？”	If you'd care to join us, the three of us could travel to Yangzhou together. I have a number of contacts there I could introduce you to. What do you think?'
红色联合的红卫兵们退后一段距离，将那个挂在高处的躯体当靶子练习射击，密集的子弹对她来说已柔和如雨，不再带来任何感觉。	The Red Guards backed up some distance and began to use the impaled body for target practice. For her, the dense storm of bullets was now no different from a gentle rain, as she could no longer feel anything.
麝月听说，忙向镜中摆手儿。	Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand.
宝玉见他星眼微饧，香腮带赤，不觉神魂早荡，一歪身坐在椅子上，笑道：“你才说什么？”	At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and smiled back at her: 'What was that you were saying just now before I came in?'
夹竹桃也开了。 平安里也是有几棵夹竹桃的，栽在晒台上碎砖围起来的一掬泥土中，开出绚烂的花朵。	Before long, the oleanders, planted haphazardly in makeshift planters formed from broken bricks on balconies, put forth their dazzling flowers.
雨打倒了无数的高粱，雨在田野里狂欢，蛤蟆躲在高粱根下，哈达哈达地抖着颌下雪白的皮肤； 狐狸蹲在幽暗的洞里，看着从高粱上飞溅而下的细小水珠，道路很快就泥泞不堪，杂草伏地，矢车菊清醒地擎着湿漉漉的头。	Sorghum crumpled under the wild rain. Toads took refuge under the stalks, their white pouches popping in and out noisily; foxes hid in their darkened dens to watch tiny drops of water splashing down from the sorghum plants.
那刘老老先听见告艰苦，只当是没想头了， 又听见给他二十两银子，喜的眉开眼笑道：“我们也知道艰难的，但只俗语说的：‘瘦死的骆驼比马还大’呢。	When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about 'difficulties' she concluded that there was no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of silver can be imagined. 'We knew you had your troubles,' she said, 'but as the saying goes, 'A starved camel is bigger than a fat horse.'
奶奶胸口里，揣着一把锋利的剪刀，它可能是为单扁郎准备的，也可能是为自己准备的。	At home she had hidden a pair of scissors in her bodice, perhaps to use on Shan Bianlang, perhaps to use on herself.
她有一次夜半被叫醒。 人们早已入睡，那叫声便显得格外惊动，带着些危急和恐怖。 王琦瑶的心擂鼓似的怦怦响着，她睡衣外面披上件夹袄便下楼去开门，见是两个乡下人，抬了一个担架，躺着垂危的病人，说是请王医师救命。	Once, awakened in the middle of the night by urgent and frightened calls for help at the door, she threw a jacket over her nightgown and rushed downstairs, her heart pounding, to find two men from the provinces carrying someone on a stretcher. The person was critically ill.
认识我的人都知道，我的腰上有旧伤，而且我身高在一米九以上。	Anyone familiar with me knew about the injury to my lower back, not to mention that I was a tall man, over six feet.
轿夫们停住，呆呆地看着劈腿横在路当中的劫路人。 那人身材不高，脸上涂着黑墨，头戴一顶高粱篾片编成的斗笠，身披一件大蓑衣，蓑衣敞着，露出密扣黑衣和拦腰扎着的宽腰带。 腰里别着一件用红绸布包起的鼓鼓囊囊的东西。	The bearers stopped in their tracks and stared dumbstruck at the highwayman of medium height who stood in the road, his legs akimbo. He had smeared his face black and was wearing a conical rain hat woven of sorghum stalks and a broad-shouldered rain cape open in front to reveal a black buttoned jacket and a wide leather belt, in which a protruding object was tucked, bundled in red satin.
对，对，郡主娘娘，咱们刻好之后，我牵了你去长安门大街，大叫：‘哪一位客官要印乌龟？ 三文钱印一张！’	Ah, yes, Little Countess, I know what. When the carving's ready, I'll be able to take you out into Changan Street and set up there as a print-seller. 'Roll up, roll up!' I'll say. 'Buy a nice turtle print, three cash a sheet!'
有一天在山上，我正好借了罗小四的汽枪，队长家的母狗正好跑到山上叫我看见，我就射出一颗子弹打瞎了它的右眼。	One day as I walked on the mountain, the team leader's dog came into view. I happened to have Luo Xiaosi's air rifle with me, so I fired a bullet and blinded her right eye.
它原先是一片蛮荒地，荆榛苇茅丛生，狐狸野兔的乐园，后来有了几架牧人的草棚，后来逃来了杀人命犯、落魄酒徒、亡命赌棍…… 他们建造房屋，开垦荒地，拓扑出人的乐园，狐狸野兔迁徙他乡，临别时齐声发出控诉人类的鸣叫。	At one time the site had been a wasteland covered with brambles, underbrush, and reeds, a paradise for foxes and wild rabbits. Then a few huts appeared, and it became a haven for escaped murderers, drunks, gamblers, who built homes, cultivated the land, and turned it into a paradise for humans, forcing out the foxes and wild rabbits, who set up howls of protest on the eve of their departure.
海老公道：“你如出力拿他这两处穴道，他就没力气和你相斗。”	'Get him on these two points,' said Hai, 'and he'll have no strength to fight with.'
石头听了大喜，因问：“不知可镌何字?	The stone was delighted. 'What words will you cut?
海老公阴恻恻的道：“很有趣罢？”	'Interesting, isn't it!' said the old eunuch with ill-disguised satisfaction.
二奶奶感到双肩冰凉，她斜了一下脸，看到躺在身侧的她的女儿、我的小姑姑正在鼾睡。	Shuddering from the cold, she tilted her head so she could see her daughter, my aunt, who was lying beside her, snoring peacefully.
你…… 你可摔痛了没有？”	Did you hurt yourself?'
她还记得我长了一头乱蓬蓬的头发，论证她是破鞋时，目光笔直地看着她。	She also remembered my head of tousled hair; how directly I stared at her when I proved she was damaged goods.
小兄弟，他教你的武功，你演给我瞧瞧。”	He turned to Trinket. 'Show me a few of the things he taught you, little brother,' he said.
你愿不愿意入我天地会做兄弟？”	Would you like to join the Triad Society and become a Brother?'
一面说，一面坐下吃茶。 那宝玉便和他说些没要紧的散话：	He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a number of unimportant topics.
他目不转睛的望着小郡主，只见她眼睛一动不动，过了好一会，突然双眼缓缓的连眨三下。	He watched her intently as she lay there, inert and unblinking. After a long pause, very slowly and deliberately, she blinked her eyes three times.
不多时，只见一个小丫头跑来，见小红站在那里，便问道：“红姐姐，你在这里作什么呢？”	She was still standing there a minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson, asked her what she was doing there.
父亲觉出余司令前跨了一大步，只手捺住了王文义的后颈皮。	Father sensed Commander Yu lurching forward to grab Wang Wenyi around the neck with both hands.
宝玉会意，忽听“唿”一声帘子响，晴雯又跑进来问道：“我怎么磨牙了?	Bao-yu took her meaning; but it was too late. With another swish of the door-blind, Skybright had already darted in again. 'Oh! Sharp-tongued, am I?
可是他什么也没说，直到进了监狱。	But he never apologized, and then he went to prison.
奶奶心中的祷语把她的芳唇冲动。	Her silent prayer made her delicate lips tremble.
倒退到二十年前，想像我和陈清扬讨论破鞋问题时的情景。	Imagine the scene twenty years ago, when Chen Qingyang and I discussed the damaged goods issue.
“说你的方案，否则就不要再发言了！” 常伟思指着大史说。	'Tell us your plan, then,' General Chang said. 'Otherwise, shut up!'
明日一早，兄弟全家便出去避一避。”	I'll leave with the family first thing tomorrow.'
坠儿满口里答应了，接了绢子，送出贾芸，回来找小红，不在话下。	Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for Crimson.
据她观察，破鞋都很善良，乐于助人，而且最不乐意让人失望。	In fact, from what she observed, damaged goods seemed to have soft hearts, loved to help others and, most of all, hated to disappoint people.
叶文洁暗想，他们怎么敢上雷达峰？	Ye wondered how they dared to come onto Radar Peak.
叶哲泰的个子很高，这四个十四岁的女孩儿只能朝上抡皮带才能打到他那不肯低下的头。	Ye was tall, and the four fourteen-year-olds had to swing their belts upward to reach his head, still held high.
爷爷在父亲的细声碎语中，用那只伤手往手枪里压子弹；日本人的迫击炮弹，在村子的围子上炸起了一团团焦黄的烟雾。	All the while Father was rambling, Granddad was loading his pistol. Japanese mortar fire raised puffs of hot yellow smoke all up and down the village wall.
我还说，你别招一大群人来看我。	I also said, Don't bring a crowd to see me.
严师母心里狐疑，嘴上却不好说，只闲扯着要重新聚一聚，可惜萨沙不在了，去西伯利亚吃苏联面包了，不过，补上那位新来的先生，也够一桌麻将了。	Madame Yan grew suspicious, but was forced to keep her thoughts to herself; instead she casually suggested that they all get together again. 'It's a pity that Sasha's no longer around. He must be off in Siberia eating his Russian bread! But that's okay, you can bring along that new friend of yours and we'll have a foursome for our mahjong games.'
钱老板道：“韦香主不用担心。	'No need for you to worry, Master,' said Butcher Qian.
好比打不过人家，给人捉住了，关在枣子桶里，当货物一般给搬来搬去，师父你可别见怪。”	'Like being captured by someone bigger and stronger than me and shut up in a barrel of dates and pushed around like goods to market. You mustn't blame me for things like that.'
王琦瑶这年是十六岁，这事情使她有了沧桑感，她觉得自己已经不止十六岁这个岁数了。	Wang Qiyao was sixteen years old at the time, but that one day's experience left her with the feeling that she had already been through a lot—she felt much older than sixteen.
这事与她无关，大概只有我会为此遭报应。	Since this had nothing to do with her, perhaps I would be the only one punished for it.
凤姐道：“不知什么缘故。”	'I don't know what the reason can be,' said Xi-feng.
以后我再也没见过她。	From that moment on, I never saw her again.
周瑞家的道：“我的娘!	'My dear good woman,' said the latter when they were out of earshot, 'whatever came over you?
爷爷怒骂。	Granddad lashed out angrily.
老子是土匪余占鳌！”	I'm Yu Zhan'ao the bandit!'
那水有齐腰深，非常急。	The water reached to my waist, and the current was very swift.
我听人说，天地会行侠仗义，做得都是惊天动地的大事，怎么会是小孩子的玩意？”	'I've heard lots about the Triad Society. It fights for Honour and Justice. It does all sorts of amazing things. Of course it isn't a children's game.'
二奶奶被奶奶赶出家门已有八年，这期间爷爷曾被骗到济南府，险些送了性命。	Eight years had passed since Grandma had kicked her out of the house. During that time, Granddad had been tricked into going to the Jinan police station, where he nearly lost his life.
好像是在一九六几年吧，两个美国人在调试一个高精度卫星接收天线时意外地发现了宇宙背景辐射……”	I think it was back in the sixties when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation when they were testing a supersensitive satellite reception antenna—'
大节下，老太太刚喜欢了一日。	This is the New Year holiday and Her Old Ladyship has been enjoying herself all day.
只可惜四十五万两银子变成了一场空欢喜。	Pity about that half a million taels though.
一般总是严家师母说，王琦瑶听，说的和听的都入神。	Madame Yan did most of the talking while Wang Qiyao listened, but both were equally absorbed in the conversation.
豆官，你的枪呢？”	Douguan, where's your gun?'
王琦瑶从此不再去片厂了，她是想把这事淡忘，最好是没发生过。	After that, Wang Qiyao stopped going. She wanted to forget the whole affair—that it had ever happened.
村子里的火声加剧了高粱地里的寂寞清冷；金黄色的微弱火光在银白色的月光中颤抖。	The cheerless and lonely sorghum field was highlighted by the crackle of fires in the village. Weak golden flames danced fitfully beneath the silvery moonlight.
流言还都有些云遮雾罩，影影绰绰，是哈了气的窗玻璃，也是蒙了灰尘的窗玻璃。	Gossip is always trailed by clouds and a screen of mist. Shadowy and indistinct, it is a fogged-up window—a windowpane covered with a layer of dust.
我二十一岁时，正在云南插队。	At twenty-one, I was placed in a production team for reeducation in Yunnan.
他的手始终紧扯着余司令的衣角，一半是自己行走，一半是余司令牵着前进，他竟觉得有些瞌睡上来，脖子僵硬，眼珠子生涩呆板。 父亲想，只要跟着罗汉大爷去墨水河，就没有空手回来的道理。	Still gripping tightly to Commander Yu's coat-tail, he was pulled along, his feet barely touching the ground. But he was getting sleepy. His neck felt stiff, his eyes were growing dull and listless, and his only thought was that as long as he could tag along behind Uncle Arhat to the Black Water River he'd never come back empty-handed.
王文义忍着咳嗽说，“嗓子眼儿发痒……”	Wang Wenyi stifled a cough. 'My throat itches. . . .'
她丝毫也不怕成为破鞋，这比被人叫做破鞋而不是破鞋好得多。	She was not the least bit worried about becoming actual damaged goods, which she much preferred to being damaged goods in name only.
我可那里敢挑他呢？”	I should never dare to find fault with her.'
这天，程先生下班后到王琦瑶处，见她脸色苍白，坐立不安，一会儿躺倒，一会儿站起，一个玻璃杯碰在地上，摔得粉碎，也顾不上去收拾。	ONE DAY MR. CHENG went to Wang Qiyao's after work to find her pale and flustered, lying down every so often and then getting up to pace around. She even knocked over a glass, which shattered on the floor, but didn't bother to pick up the pieces.
潘寒接着说：“在座的各位都是《三体》的优秀玩家，成绩最好，也都很投人。	Pan continued. 'Everyone here is an excellent Three Body player. You have the best scores and are devoted to it.
叔叔大安了，也是我们一家子的造化。”	'But I'm glad you are better, Uncle. That's a piece of good fortune for all of us.'
而且是为我闪烁，汪淼心里说。	And it will be flickering for me, Wang thought.
两人都是聪敏人，又还年轻，没叫时间磨钝了心，一点就通的。	Both being still young and bright, their sensitivity had not yet been ground down by time, and they quickly understood how each other felt.
韦小宝双臂被他一托，突然间全身一热，打了个颤，便拜不下去。	Trinket could feel the scholar's strong hands on his arms. A warm sensation passed through his body, followed by a little tremor of excitement. He abandoned his kowtow and got up.
后来人保组的同志找我商量，说是要开个大的批斗会。	After a while, the security comrades came to talk to me, telling me about the big denouncement meeting they were going to hold.
烦那位太爷替我请他出来。”	Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?'
我先孝敬了母亲，赶着就给你们老太太、姨母送了些去。 如今留了些，我要自己吃恐怕折福，左思右想除我之外惟你还配吃。	I've given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I've still got a lot left over. I can't eat it all myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is worthy to eat a present like this is you.
短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、长长短短短，这是1108：21：37。	short-long-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-short-long-long, long-long-short-short-short. That's 1108:21:37, Wang thought.
村里街道上也水深及膝，骡马牛羊都泡在水里，水上漂着牲畜们稀薄的排泄物。	The water in the village was knee-high, covering the legs of livestock, whose waste floated on the surface.
我在一边看完了才走。	I didn't leave until I witnessed the whole episode.
低头看去，宽阔笔直的马路上跑着如豆的汽车，成串的亮珠子。	Below, the cars speeding down the straight broad roads looked like a chain of pearls.
成名如此之早，当真古今罕有。”	To have won such fame, and so early in life too, is an almost unparalleled achievement.'
待雄飞高举，明冬再晤，岂非大快之事！”	How delightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!'
纵声大笑，身子跟着乱动，右腿一曲，右手已抓住了匕首柄，极慢极慢的从剑鞘中拔出，不发出丝毫声息，就算有了些微声，也教笑声给遮掩住了。	He kept up the artificial laughter in order to cover up the wriggling of his body. While he was talking and laughing he had managed to draw up his right leg so that he could get his hand on the dagger in his boot and draw it from its sheath. Any slight sound that this operation might have given rise to was masked by his idiotic cachinnation.
他似乎没听见。 我劈手把牛鼻绳夺了下来，他就朝我挥了一巴掌。	He didn't seem to hear me, so I snatched the tether from him and he slapped me without thinking.
世界是平的，向各个方向延伸到很远很远，但总是有边的。	The world was flat and extended very far in each direction, but ultimately there was an edge where it met the sky.
其实我们随时可以逃走，但她不乐意。	Actually, we could have left anytime, but she didn't want to.
后来人家又不怀疑我们去了国外，开始对她比较客气，经常叫她到医院去，给参谋长看前列腺炎。	Later on they stopped suspecting we had gone abroad. They began to deal with Chen Qingyang in a more civilized way, often asking her to go to the hospital and treat the prostatitis of the chief of staff.
急的霍启直寻了半夜， 至天明不见，那霍启也不敢回来见主人，便逃往他乡去了。	Frantically he searched for her throughout the rest of the night; but when day dawned and he had still not found her, he took to his heels, not daring to face his master and mistress, and made off for another part of the country.
那男孩反手抓住他右腿使劲一扯，韦小宝仰面便倒。	The boy quickly grabbed his right leg and tugged at it, sending Trinket crashing down on his back.
王琦瑶听了这话又是一笑，仰起脸看了严师母说道：我这样的人，还谈什么结婚不结婚的话呢？	Wang Qiyao responded with another laugh. Raising her head, she looked Madame Yan straight in the eye. 'A woman like me. . . . How could I talk of marriage?'
她承认她那天心情非常激动，确实像考拉熊。	She admitted that she was very excited that night and really felt like a koala bear.
我们村子的历史又翻开了新的一页。	A page in the history of our village had been turned.
这是深入肌肤，已经谈不上是亲是近，反有些起腻，暗底里生畏的，却是有一股噬骨的感动。	This is a feeling that, having penetrated the flesh, goes beyond closeness. One begins to weary of it. It breeds a secret fear, but hidden within that fear is an excitement that gnaws down to the bone.
“昨天高密大集，有去赶集卖草鞋的没有？”香色呢礼帽又问。	'Did he take his straw sandals to market day in Gaomi yesterday?'
其为崖山以后耶？ 如此江山不忍视。	Or is it after Mount Yai's fateful leap? This lovely land then scarce dared breathe its name.
他为甚么不去禀报皇上？	But I wonder why he doesn't tell the Emperor?
忽然灯光一闪，只见贾蔷举着个蜡台，照道：“谁在这屋里呢？”	Suddenly a light flashed --- and there was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around: 'Who is in this room?'
“为什么？”	'Why?'
凤姐笑而不睬，叫平儿把昨儿那包银子拿来，再拿一串钱，都送至刘老老跟前。	But Xi-feng laughed quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.
你们的ID将被注销，下面请你们离开。	Your IDs will be deleted. Please leave now.
那老者掀起门帷，说道：“‘小白龙’韦小宝韦爷到！”	There, stopping outside a doorway, the old man with the grizzled beard lifted up the door-curtain and announced them. 'Mr Trinket Wei, the Little White Dragon to see you.'
韦小宝见他不是向自己走来，暗暗舒了口气，心道：“老乌龟好厉害，眼睛虽然瞎了，居然能追到这里。”	Trinket breathed a silent sigh of relief when he saw that he was not walking in his direction. 'Who'd have thought the Old Turtle would be able to follow me all the way here in spite of being blind?' he thought.
只是许多时不走动，知道他如今是怎样?	'But it's a long time since you had anything to do with him and hard to say how he may prove after all these years.
要知端的，且听下回分解。	If you wish for further details, you may learn them in the following chapter.
中间退出来一次，只见小和尚上血迹斑斑。	I pulled out once in the middle of it and found my little Buddha smeared with blood.
男的原来是个猎户，也采些药材，后来周围的林子越来越少，就种地了，但人们还是叫他齐猎头儿。	The old man used to be a hunter and also gathered some herbs for traditional medicine. Later, after the forest around the area was lost to logging, the couple had turned to farming, but people still called him Hunter Qi out of habit.
不是吗？ 太空电梯其实就是一条运河，像巴拿马运河连接了两个大洋一样，太空电梯将地球和太空连接起来……”	Indeed, the space elevator is a canal. Just as the Panama Canal connected two oceans, the space elevator will connect space with the Earth.'
贾瑞道：“果真么？”	'Do you really mean this?' said Jia Rui.
只篦了三五下儿，见晴雯忙忙走进来取钱，一见他两个，便冷笑道：“哦!	But he had not drawn it more than four or five times through her hair, when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money. Seeing the two of them together, she smiled sarcastically: 'Fancy!
她猜想他是一个小开，舞场上的旧知那类人物，就从他身上派生出许多想象。	She took him to be some kind of playboy whom Wang Qiyao must have known back in her dance hall days. Madame Yan imagined all kinds of things about Mr. Cheng.
该女儿说，好哇，你们原来是这么造的我！	Her daughter said, Wow! So that's how the two of you made me.
她又笑，说道：不怎么。	She smiled and said, Nothing.
自己要睡，天气尚早。	He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too early.
轿夫们加快了步伐。	The bearers quickened their pace.
如果我多看她一眼，她就笑笑。	If I looked at her again, she smiled back.
你只顾一时为我得罪了人，他们都记在心里，遇着坎儿，说的好说不好听的，大家什么意思呢？”	You don't seem to realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you've forgotten all about it. But they haven't. It's all scored up against me; and as soon as something goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it so unpleasant for all of us.'
天上一轮才捧出，人间万姓仰头看。	As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways, On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.'
见了凤姐，满面陪笑，连连问好。	He came into the room wreathed in smiles and overwhelmed Xi-feng with civilities.
一面说一面递了个眼色儿。	Zhou Rui's wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie Liu as she said this.
不过…… 不过……”	'But. . . but—'
两个男青年步伐稳健有力，一副成熟的青年布尔什维克形象，他们都是物理系理论物理专业大四年级的，叶哲泰曾是他们的老师；那四名女孩子要年轻得多，都是大学附中的初二学生，这些穿着军装扎着武装带的小战士挟带着逼人的青春活力，像四团绿色的火焰包围着叶哲泰。	The two young men strode with confidence and purpose, the very image of mature Bolshevik youths. They were both fourth-year students majoring in theoretical physics, and Ye was their professor. The women, really girls, were much younger, second-year students from the junior high school attached to the university. Dressed in military uniforms and equipped with bandoliers, they exuded youthful vigor and surrounded Ye Zhetai like four green flames.
贾芸忙上前请了安，宝玉让坐，便在下面一张椅子上坐了。	Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he modestly placed himself on a bedside chair.
守信肯定不是罪孽。	Keeping a promise is certainly no sin.
我听了这些话，一声不吭。	I kept silent as I heard the words.
海老公慢慢松开左手，低声道：“快带我去。”	He released the pressure on her throat. 'Come on! Take me there!'
后来陈清扬告诉我，罗小四到处找我。	Later Chen Qingyang told me that Luo Xiaosi had looked for me everywhere.
陈清扬听了这话，脸色发红，怒目圆睁，几乎就要打我一耳光。	As Chen Qingyang listened to my words, her face flushed and her eyes widened with anger. She looked like she was about to slap me.
小玄子哈哈大笑，放了他起身。	Misty laughed and set him free.
她所讨厌的是使她成为破鞋那件事本身。	What disgusted her was the act that made her damaged goods.
奶奶站在路边，听着七零八落的打击肉体的沉闷声响，对着余占鳌顿眸一瞥，然后仰面看着天边的闪电，脸上凝固着的，仍然是那种粲然的、黄金一般高贵辉煌的笑容。	Grandma stood beside the road listening to the dull cacophony of fists and feet on flesh; she glanced at Yu Zhan'ao, then looked up at the lightning-streaked sky, the radiant, golden, noble smile still frozen on her face.
我告诉他，我没有东西（食品、炊具等等），所以不能去温泉。	I told him that I didn't have anything (food, utensils, etc.), so I couldn't go to the thermal springs.
他的意识中一片空白，只有倒计时在那暗红的背景辐射上显现着，跳动着，他自己仿佛变成了一个单纯的计时器，一口不知道为谁而呜的丧钟。	His mind was empty of thoughts: Only the countdown pulsed against the dim red background of cosmic radiation. He seemed to have turned into nothing but a simple timer, a bell that tolled for he knew not whom.
队长说他没想整我，是三闷儿的娘闹得他没办法。	The team leader said he didn't want to give me a hard time; it was Shan Men Er's mother who was giving him a hard time.
像她们这样半路上的朋友，各有各的隐衷，别看严家师母竹筒倒豆子，内中也有自己未必知道的保留，彼此并不知根知底，能有一些同情便可以了。	People like them, who become friends at mid-life, tend to keep part of themselves hidden away. Even Madame Yan, who usually wore her heart on her sleeve, retained certain secrets that she herself might not have understood. It was not necessary for them to know everything there was to know about each other—a little sympathy went a long way.
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”	Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'
也正是这个，促使程先生来找蒋丽莉了。	This was what had motivated him to seek out Jiang Lili.
写了好几遍，终于写出陈清扬像考拉熊。	After a few drafts, I finally wrote that Chen Qingyang looked like a koala bear.
话都说得有些不搭调，可也是借酒吐真言，放了平时则是难出口的。	Her words were inappropriate to the occasion; obviously, alcohol was bringing out some hidden truths.
一直沉默的斯坦顿上校站了起来，“我去叫警官回来。”	Colonel Stanton, who had been silent the whole time, stood up. 'I will go and ask Officer Shi to come back.'
这些话她好像很听得进去，但是从不附合。	Words like this seemed to please her, although she never agreed with what I said out loud.
顾炎武道：“当今之世，便真有桃源乐土，咱们也不能独善其身，去躲了起来……”	'Come,' said Gu, 'even if there were such a place, we cannot, as individuals, opt out altogether. In times like these—'
轿夫们的话更加粗野了，他们有的骂我外曾祖父是个见钱眼开的小人，有的说鲜花插到牛粪上，有的说单扁郎是个流白脓淌黄水的麻风病人。	The bearers' banter turned coarse. One of them reviled my great-granddad for being a money-grabber, another said something about a pretty flower stuck into a pile of cowshit, a third called Shan Bianlang a scruffy leper who oozed pus and excreted yellow fluids.
凤姐道：“可知男人家见一个爱一个也是有的。”	'Men are all the same!' said Xi-feng. 'They have only to set eyes on a woman to begin another affair.'
这一晚是国庆夜，有哪幢楼的平台上，放起礼花，孤零零的一朵，在湛黑的天空上缓缓地舒开叶瓣，又缓缓凋零成细细的流星，渐渐消失，空中还留有一团浅白的影。	The party took place on the evening of National Day and fireworks were being set off from one of the balconies. A single rocket shot up into the darkness and slowly unfurled its fiery petals in the night sky before breaking up into a stream of falling stars, which vanished slowly, leaving a faint white shadow in the sky.
如果我要安慰她，并不困难。 我可以从逻辑上证明她不是破鞋。	If I'd wanted to comfort her, it wouldn't have been hard; I could prove logically that she was not damaged goods.
下半截沉在黑暗里，上半截仍浮在阳光中。	The lower half of the cloud was immersed in darkness and the upper half still floated in sunshine.
奶奶脑后垂着一根油光光的大辫子，脖子上挂着一个沉甸甸的银锁——我外曾祖父是个打造银器的小匠人。	Her long shiny braids shone, and a heavy silver necklace hung around her neck – Great-Granddad was a silversmith.
我想纯粹为我，这样太自私了，所以就很少干。	I thought it would be too selfish if it were only for me. So I rarely asked for it.
等着奶奶下来，我细细儿的回明了，想来奶奶也不至嗔着我莽撞的。”	I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come back and explain it all to her. I hope she won't be angry with me for pushing myself forward.'
我那里那么大工夫管这些事?	I told her, I've got better things to do with my time than go looking for people's handkerchiefs.
两人打得兴起，都不提赌银子的事。	They had both been quite carried away by the fighting, and neither of them had mentioned the money, or the bet they had laid.
除了锅碗盆瓢，还有足够两人吃一个月的东西。	In addition to a wok, bowls, a basin, and ladle, there was enough food for two of us to eat for an entire month.
清平的温泉是山坳里一片泥坑，周围全是荒草坡。	The Qingping thermal springs were mud pools located in a valley, surrounded by nothing but wild, grassy hills.
那天早上天色微明，我从山上下来，到猪场喂猪。	That morning, right at dawn, I went down the mountain to feed the pigs.
蕊初道：“花园里有大海龟吗？	'I didn't know there were any in the Palace,' said Blossom.
天上白云匆匆，深山里只有我们两个人。	The white cloud in the sky hurried on its journey, and there were only two of us in the midst of mountains.
小红道：“你那里知道我心里的事！”	'Why not?' said Crimson. 'How do you know what is on my mind?'
韦小宝脸皮再厚，也知自己的武功实在太不高明，说道：“老乌龟教我的都是假功夫。	However immune to self-criticism Trinket might be, he knew that what he liked to call his Martial Arts training was really a joke. 'The Old Devil only pretended to teach me,' he said.
又像有人在背后追赶，一浪一浪接替不暇。	One was driven about by a succession of waves.
王琦瑶看程先生的眼睛很不像过去，有些无赖似的，不知是喝了酒还是有别的原因，心里不安着，脸上便带了安抚的笑容，说：	Wang Qiyao was a bit disconcerted by the unfamiliar glint in his eyes—she wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or something else—so she put on a placating smile.
这两个人，一个是前面提到的自由猎手老耿；另一个是当过吹鼓手、喜欢唱京戏的成麻子。	Who were they? One was Old Geng, the other a onetime musician who loved to sing Peking opera – Pocky Cheng.
那贾瑞此时要命心急，无药不吃，只是白花钱，不见效。	Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swallowed every medicine that they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any good.
“知道的不多。	'I don't know much.
总舵主凝神观看，待韦小宝使完后，点了点头，道：“从你出手中看来，似乎你还学过少林寺的一些擒拿手，是不是？”	The Helmsman watched him with fixed attention and nodded when he had finished. 'From what you've just been doing,' he said, 'it looks as though you may have been taught a little bit of the Shaolin School of Catch-Can. Am I right?'
这鼓舞了小红卫兵们，她们更加投入地继续着这“崇高”的战斗，她们在为信念而战，为理想而战，她们为历史给予自己的光辉使命所陶醉，为自己的英勇而自豪……	The young Red Guards, encouraged by their success, became even more devoted to this glorious struggle. They were fighting for faith, for ideals. They were intoxicated by the bright light cast on them by history, proud of their own bravery....
“后来我们走向广阔天地了！”	'Then, we were sent to the wilderness!'
小红抬头见是小丫头子坠儿。	Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of the maids from Green Delights.
黄宗羲神色惨淡，摇了摇头。 顾炎武却自斟自饮，一口气连干了六七杯。	Huang Zongxi declined gloomily with a brief shake of the head; but Gu Yanwu, helping himself unceremoniously from the wine-kettle, downed half a dozen of the tiny cupfuls in quick succession.
1．弄堂	Longtang
唉，睡觉的时候以后可多着呢，朝也睡，晚也睡，睡着了永远不醒。	There's plenty of sleeping to come: sleeping all day, sleeping all night, sleeping and never waking up again.
父亲听到爷爷被饼噎得哦哦地叫，看到那些棱角分明的饼块从爷爷的喉咙里缓慢地往下蠕动。	Father heard Granddad's painful cries as the dry cake stuck in his throat and saw the rough edges make their way down his neck.
最后月亮从门对面的窗子里照进来。 这时我和她分开。	At last the moonlight shone through the window opposite the door and we were separate by then.
她们俩却是这漠然里的一个活跃，虽然也是不做声，却是有着几百年的大事在酝酿的。	Amid this sea of indifference, Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen were animated and alive. Though neither said a word, centuries of anticipation and excitement were brewing inside them.
透明单薄布满血管的大耳朵是王文义头上引人注目的器官。 他个子很小，一颗大头缩在耸起的双肩中。	Large transparent ears covered with tiny blood vessels were the trademark of Wang Wenyi, a small man whose enlarged head was tucked down between his shoulders.
这个大平面上布满了大兴安岭这样的山脉，也布满了森林，林间点缀着一个个像齐家屯一样的村庄……	The flat surface was covered with mountain ranges like the Greater Khingan Mountains, and with forests dotted with tiny villages, just like Qijiatun....
“审判日”号正在过去，它在通过死亡之琴。	Judgment Day was below them now, passing through the deadly zither.
黛玉自觉忘情，不觉红了脸，拿袖子遮了脸，翻身向里装睡着了。	Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep.
一丝甜味的液体温暖着他的口腔。 奶奶在他屁股上用力打了一巴掌，然后把他推出去。	Trickles of a sweet liquid warmed the corners of his mouth, until Grandma gave him a swat on the bottom and pushed him away.
他的派对渐渐地有了名声，一传十，十传百的，来的人呢，也是一带十，十带百，他全是欢迎。	Gradually, his parties started to gain some notoriety: word traveled fast, as one guest brought ten friends and each of them brought along others—but he didn't mind, everyone was welcome.
“史强，出去。” 常伟思厉声说。	'Da Shi, get out of here!' General Chang said.
“夜里船上的人睡觉啊，都是躺着的，五十厘米的空当太大了，白天他们就是坐着或蹲着，也够了。”	'At night the crew will be sleeping, which means they'll all be lying down. Fifty centimeters between filaments leaves too much of a gap. But during the day, even if they're sitting or crouching, the distance is sufficient.'
未知去后如何，且听下回分解。	And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the next chapter.
刚说到这里，只听二门上小厮们回说：“东府里小大爷进来了。” 凤姐忙和刘老老摆手道：“不必说了。”	She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of 'the young master from the Ning mansion' and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop. 'It's all right. There is no need to tell me.'
只因素日闻得人说，嫂子是个利害人，在你跟前一点也错不得，所以唬住我了。 我如今见嫂子是个有说有笑极疼人的，我怎么不来?	True, there was a time when I should have been scared to come, because people always told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you; but now I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun, there is nothing that could stop me coming.
喂她最多的是齐猎头儿的儿媳妇，叫大凤，这个健壮的东北妮子每天吃着高粱米大渣子，同时奶两个娃，奶水还是旺旺的。	The one who nursed her the most was Hunter Qi's daughter-in-law, called Feng. Feng had the strong, solid frame of the women of the Northeast. She ate sorghum every day, and her large breasts were full of milk even though she was feeding two babies at the same time.
这里有一些老住户，与平安里同龄，他们是平安里的见证人一样，用富于历史感的眼睛，审视着那些后来的住户。	Each Peace Lane has a few residents who are as old as the neighborhood. Being history's witnesses, they observe newcomers with knowing eyes.
却不知那宝玉是不要人怕他的。	She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of him.
躺在漏雨的草屋里，听着远处的狼叫，慢慢从梦里回到现实。	We lay in leaky straw huts and listened to wolves cry in the night, and gradually we woke from our dreams.
“猛捅——猛捅——”	'Poo-pah – poo-pah –'
凤姐道：“这会子你先去罢。”	'Now I think you had better go.'
王琦瑶停了一下，说：程先生睡不着吗？	Wang Qiyao hesitated before asking, 'Can't you get to sleep?'
又向焙茗道：“反叛杂种，还跪着做什么？”	He turned to Tealeaf: 'Treacherous little beast! What are you still kneeling for?'
老头身后的柳树上，拴着两头牛犊子、三只山羊，一头小毛驴。	Behind him, two calves, three goats, and a mule were tied to a willow tree.
说着，又问周瑞家的：“回了太太了没有？”	She turned to Zhou Rui's wife. 'Have you told Her Ladyship yet?'
你奶奶的，脸色这等难看！”	What a miserable-looking lot!'
韦小宝毛骨悚然，道：“我…… 我以为你不爱喝汤。	Trinket could feel his skin crawling. 'But. . . but... I thought you didn't like soup,' he said.
这些真东西是体面后头的东西，它们是说给自己也不敢听的，于是就拿来，制作流言了。	These articles lie outside the parameters of what is dignified; their nature is such that no one dares speak of them aloud—and so they are taken and molded into gossip.
后来我回内地时，站在公路上等汽车，也有两种选择，可以等下去，也可以回农场去。	Later when I was going back to the interior, waiting for the bus by the road, I also had two choices: I could keep waiting, or return to the farm.
听到这个名字，王琦瑶把脸转到一边，背着严师母，停了一会儿才说：是呀，我也有好久没看见他了。	At the mention of his name, Wang Qiyao turned away. It was only after a long silence that she replied, 'That's right, it's been ages since I've seen him.'
我以为我的交待材料最有文彩。	I thought of all the confessions mine would be the richest and most vivid.
在奶奶脚前的那个轿夫——我后来的爷爷余占鳌，他的心里，有一种不寻常的预感，像熊熊燃烧的火焰一样，把他未来的道路照亮了。	My grandfather, the bearer directly in front of Grandma's foot, felt a strange premonition blazing inside him and illuminating the path his life would take.
至于那把双筒猎枪，也是一宝。	As for that double-barreled shotgun, it was a treasure as well.
“这毕竟是目前公认的最符合实验结果的解释。”	'It is, after all, the explanation recognized to be most in line with experimental results.'
道人道：“既如此，便随你去来。”	'Very good, I will go with you then,' said the Taoist.
目今其祖早故，只有一个儿子，名唤王成，因家业萧条，仍搬出城外乡村中住了。	The grandfather had long since died, leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who, having fallen on hard times, had moved back into the countryside somewhere outside the capital.
这娘们随时可能翻了脸给我一耳光，假定如此，就证明女人不懂什么是交情。	The woman could change her mind any minute and slap me—if that occurred, it would only prove that women didn't understand what great friendship meant.
韦小宝双手撑地，只想使劲弹起来，但胸口要害处给对手按住了，什么力气都使不出来，僵持良久，只得又投降一次。	Trinket stretched and heaved with all his might (what little of it he had left), but his opponent was still astride his aching ribs, and his efforts were to no avail. After several more minutes of futile struggle, he surrendered yet again.
说实在的，她没有这方面的嗜好。 但是为了交情，她忍住了。	To tell the truth, she didn't have this particular hobby, but tolerated it for the sake of their friendship.
能不能十个打他们一个？”	Enough to fight them ten to one?'
因此发狠，按倒打了三四十板，还不许他吃饭，叫他跪在院内读文章，定要补出十天工课来方罢。	Thereupon he, forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared the equivalent of ten days' homework.
当然打陈清扬屁股也不是好事，但是我想别的破鞋和野汉子之间未必有这样的事。	Of course, it was wrong to slap her bottom, but I thought this kind of thing might not be what other damaged goods and their lovers get into.
你那里肯往我这里来？”	'What would you want to come here for?'
他感到有些凉意上来，用力把衰衣裹紧。 手不慎碰到肚皮，又觉腹中饥饿难忍。	He wrapped the cape tightly around him to ward off the chill, and as his hand brushed against his belly he realised how hungry he was.
拍摄的现场又是要多破烂有多破烂，可是从开麦拉里摄取的画面总是整洁美妙。	The set locations may have been dilapidated and in disrepair, but the images captured by the camera were always perfectly beautiful.
小红听了，冷笑两声，方要说话，只见一个未留头的小丫头走进来，手里拿着些花样子并两张纸，说道：“这两个花样子叫你描出来呢。”	Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot's simplicity or at Bao-yu's improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl's horns. She was carrying some patterns and sheets of paper. 'You're to copy out these two patterns.'
她浑身的皮肤绷紧，好像抛过光的大理石。	Her skin all over was as smooth as a piece of burnished marble.
队长说，谁是王二？	The team leader said, Who's Wang Er?
父亲只见过一次真正的秋水，那时候高粱即将收割，墨水河水暴涨，堤坝决裂，洪水灌进了田地和村庄。	He had only really seen autumn water once in his life. The sorghum was ready for harvest when the Black Water River rose and burst its banks, flooding both the fields and the village.
空气凝固了，所有人像石化般一动不动，连周围电脑的嗡嗡声似乎都变得小心翼翼。	The air seemed frozen. Everyone present stayed still like stone statues. Even the droning from the computers all around them seemed more careful.
“这儿这么多重量级人物，我刚才怕轮不上我，那样老领导您又会说我这人没礼貌了。”	'There are so many important people here that I didn't think it was my place to speak. And I was afraid that you, General, would say I was being rude again.'
明明听得韦小宝是落在一株芍药花旁，这小鬼手中的宝剑或许已震得远远飞出，可是他的尸体怎会突然不见？	According to his calculation, Trinket must have fallen into the bed of peonies. He could understand that the weapon might have flown from his hand and be lying at quite some distance away, but where was the body?
我发现我不能顶三个妇女，尤其是腰疼时。	I found that I could not manage three women's work, especially when my back hurt.
像往常一样，我一声不吭，他喋喋不休。	As usual, I stayed mute and he kept nagging at me.
正值宝玉走来，见了这般景况，问：“是怎么了？”	Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in, asked him what was the matter.
吕留良提笔沉吟半晌，便在画上振笔直书。 顷刻诗成，诗云：	He picked up a writing-brush and for some minutes could be observed muttering to himself in the throes of composition; then, writing straight on to the painting and with pauses only for moistening the brush, he quickly completed the following poem:
我们还聊了几句，我说她的乳房不但圆，而且长的很端正，脐窝不但圆，而且很浅。	We chatted for a while. I told her that her breasts were not just full, but also shapely; her navel not only round, but shallow too.
但是她偏要这么写。	But she insisted on writing in this way.
刘老老一面走，一面笑说道：“你老是‘贵人多忘事’了，那里还记得我们？”	Grannie Liu followed her cackling. 'You know what they say: 'Important people have short memories.' I wouldn't expect you to remember the likes of us!'
父亲，一九五七年，你躲在我家里间屋里那个地洞里时，你每日每夜，在永恒的黑暗中，追忆流水年月，你至少三百六十次想到了我们家那几十间房屋的屋盖在大火中塌落的情景。 你想到你的父亲我的爷爷在那时刻想到了什么，我的幻想紧追着你的幻想，你的幻想紧追着爷爷的思维。	Father, when you were hiding in the burrow we dug for you in the floor of my home back in 1957, you recalled those days of your past in the unrelenting darkness. On no fewer than 365 occasions, in your mind you saw the roof of your house crash down amid the flames, and wondered what was going through the mind of your father, my granddad. So my fantasies were chasing yours while yours were chasing Granddad's.
会开得很乱。	The meeting was a complete mess.
小弟和顾兄前日得到讯息，原来这场‘明史’大案，竟将伊璜先生也牵连在内。”	The day before yesterday Gu and I learned that he has now been named in connection with the Ming History affair.'
韦小宝道：“两件成不成？”	'What about two bad things?' said Trinket.
窗户上已布满淡薄的晨曦，那块巴掌大的窗玻璃上结着奇形怪状的霜花。	The window was coated with pale morning sunlight; a grotesque pattern of frost had formed on the pane.
父亲跟着队伍进了高粱地后，由于心随螃蟹横行斜走，脚与腿不择空隙，撞得高粱棵子东倒西歪。	As Father followed the troops into the sorghum field, he moved sideways, crablike, overshooting the spaces between the stalks and bumping them hard, which caused them to sway and bend violently.
蕊初道：“我…… 我在这里玩儿！”	'I'm just. . . just playing,' said Blossom.
那文士提笔蘸上了墨，在纸上写了个“鹿”字，说道：“鹿这种野兽，虽是庞然大物，性子却极为平和，只吃青草和树叶，从来不伤害别的野兽。	The man picked up a writing-brush and moistened it on the ink-slab, then, on a sheet of paper, he wrote the character for a deer. 'The deer is a wild animal, but although it is comparatively large, it has a very peaceable nature. It eats only grass and leaves and never harms other animals.
可此时她只是一个豁出去，反倒是很镇定，竟能注意到周围，听见有邻近棚里传出来的“开麦拉”的叫声。	But having decided to let everything ride, she was actually quite calm and composed. She was aware of everything going on around her, down to the shouts of 'Camera' coming from the adjacent set.
我把这事说了出来，以为陈清扬一定不记得。	When I mentioned this to Chen Qingyang, I thought she'd have forgotten.
侧过了头倾听。	He cocked his head to listen.
余占鳌对着劫路人笔直地走过去，他薄薄的嘴唇绷成一条刚毅的直线，两个嘴角一个上翘，一个下垂。	Yu Zhan'ao approached the highwayman, his thin lips curled resolutely, up at one end and down at the other.
平儿站在炕沿边，打量了刘老老两眼，只得问个好，让了坐。	Patience, who was standing by the edge of the kang, made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her with a civil 'how-do-you-do' and an invitation to be seated.
桥墩就可以用作拉丝的柱子。”	The abutments at the two ends of the bridge can serve as the pillars for stringing the filaments.'
只有我例外。	I was the only exception.
我说，既然你不愿意见它，那就算了。	I said, since you don't even want to look at him, let's just forget the whole thing.
爷爷走着，他已经感觉不到自己的腿在何处，只是凭着一种走的强烈意念，在僵硬的空气的浊浪中，困难地挣扎。	All that kept Granddad moving was a powerful drive to push on and continue the bitter struggle against wave after murky wave of obdurate air.
海老公脸一沉，说道：“借给老吴这小子有什么用？	Old Hai scowled at him. 'What do you want to go lending money to that Wu fellow for?
如果发生你所说的超过百分之一振幅的波动，这条线就会变红并将波动显示出来。	If the kind of fluctuation you anticipate—in excess of one percent—occurs, this line would turn red and become a waveform.
如今出挑的美人儿似的，少说着只怕有一万心眼子；再要赌口齿，十个会说的男人也说不过他呢！	She's grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian. But sharp! Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day of the week!
我办过一个盗窃案，罪犯能把行驶中的列车中间的一节车厢偷了，前后的其余部分又完好地接起来开到终点站，用的工具只是一根钢丝绳和几只铁钩子。	I once handled a robbery where the criminals managed to steal one car out of a moving train. They reconnected the cars before and after the one they were interested in so that the train got all the way to its destination without anyone noticing. The only tools they used were a length of wire cable and a few steel hooks.
老耿那时已七十多岁，孤身一人，享受“五保”待遇，是村里德高望重的人物，每逢诉苦大会，都要他上台诉苦。 每次诉苦，他都要剥掉上衣，露出一片疤痕。	Old Geng, who was already over seventy by then and lived alone as a pensioner, was one of our most revered villagers. Asked to speak at meetings to air grievances against the old order, he invariably stripped to the waist onstage to show his scars.
我走过去，告诉他，这牛被毒蛇咬了，不能干活。	I went over to tell him that the buffalo had been bitten by a poisonous snake and couldn't work.
这天下午，程先生提前下班，买了菜到王琦瑶处，两人将孩子哄睡了，便一起忙了起来，一边忙一边说话。	On the afternoon of the dinner Mr. Cheng left work early to pick up the food for that evening. They put the baby to bed early and chatted as they cooked.
青天哟——蓝天哟——花花绿绿的天哟——棒槌哟亲哥哟你死了——可就塌了妹妹的天哟——	A blue sky yo – a sapphire sky yo – a painted sky yo – a mighty cudgel yo – dear elder brother yo – death has claimed you – you have brought down little sister's sky yo –.
由于室外作业，长年都是黝黑的皮肤。	He had a dark complexion from years of working outdoors.
老子叫你不许哭，就不许哭！”	'I forbid you to cry.'
这情景持续了很长时间后，她在朦胧中想到，这可能就是她永恒的归宿了，这就是她的地狱，三个太阳构成的地狱之火将永远灼烧着她，这是她因那个超级背叛受到的惩罚。	This state lasted for some time, and she hazily thought it was probably the end for her. It was her hell. The fire of the three suns would torment her and burn her forever. This was punishment for her betrayal, the betrayal that exceeded all others.
下午来打针多是在三四点钟，这一小时总空着，只她们俩，面对面地坐。 夏天午间的困盹还没完全过去，禁不住哈欠连哈欠的。 她们强打精神，自己都不知说的什么。 弄口梧桐树上的蝉一迭声叫，传进来是嗡嗡的，也是不清楚。	Most of Wang Qiyao's patients came between three and four o'clock, so they had an hour to kill. Sitting across from each other in the lazy summer afternoon, they would stifle their yawns and chatter on without fully realizing what they were talking about, as cicadas droned in the parasol tree at the entrance to the longtang.
那堂倌一转身，程先生便伏在桌上哭了，眼泪成串地落在碱水刷白的白木桌面上。	As soon as the waiter turned away, Mr. Cheng bent over the table and started to cry, a stream of tears falling steadily on the bleached table cloth.
又伸手在他头颈两侧轻轻一按。	Old Hai reached out his hand and pressed lightly on either side of Trinket's neck.
——说来虽近荒唐，细玩颇有趣味。	Though the answer to this question may at first seem to border on the absurd, reflection will show that there is a good deal more in it than meets the eye.
做过这事和喜欢这事大不一样。	Doing something is very different from liking it.
在校园中，红卫兵、文革工作组、工宣队和军宣队，相互之间都在爆发尖锐的冲突，而每种派别的内部又时时分化出新的对立派系，捍卫着各自不同的背景和纲领，爆发更为残酷的较量。	Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers' Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team. And each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.
对于领导来说，我不存在有很大的便利，可以说明此地没有一个知青被打晕。	For our team leader, my nonexistence was very convenient, because then no one could prove any of the city students had been beaten senseless.
韦小宝不明白他说些什么，只是见他神色欢愉，确是解开了心中一件极为难之事，也不禁代他高兴。	Trinket didn't understand what he was talking about, but he could tell from his pleased expression that some great weight had been lifted from his mind and couldn't help feeling pleased on his behalf.
爷爷活动了几下胳膊，说：“好多了，豆官，这样的灵丹妙药，什么样的重伤也能治好。”	Granddad moved his arm back and forth. 'Much better, Douguan. An elixir like this will work on any wound, no matter how serious.'
因问周瑞家的道：“这老老不知用了早饭没有呢？”	She turned to Zhou Rui's wife. 'I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today?'
斗过这一台，我们就算没事了。	After this round of public denouncement, we thought we were done with it.
周瑞家的听了，便已猜着几分来意。 只因他丈夫昔年争买田地一事，多得狗儿他父亲之力，今见刘老老如此，心中难却其意；二则也要显弄自己的体面。 便笑说：“老老你放心。	From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman's visit; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now, when she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one. 'Don't you worry, Grannie!
他也想去赶街，可是不到放我们回去的时候，让我们呆在这里无人看管，又不合规定。	He also wanted to go to the market, but it wasn't time to release us yet and leaving us unattended was against the rules.
单家利用廉价原料酿酒牟利，富甲一方。 我奶奶能嫁给单扁郎，是我外曾祖父的荣耀。	By using cheap grain to make wine, the Shan family made a very good living, and marrying my grandma off to them was a real feather in Great-Granddad's cap.
她说好。	She said, No problem.
可是你使一招，我学一招，最多给你多摔几交，你的法子我总能学了来。”	All I have to do is watch his moves and copy them. He can throw me a few times— I'll soon get the hang of it.'
那时他刚参加余司令的队伍，任副官在演练场上对他也对其他队员喊：向右转——，王文义欢欢喜喜地跺着脚，不知转到哪里去了。	He had just joined up with Commander Yu. Adjutant Ren ordered the recruits: Right face! Wang Wenyi stomped down joyfully, but where he intended to 'face' was anyone's guess.
她不相信，又不敢不信，心里有些挣扎。	She could not believe it, neither did she dare not to believe it. Deep down her heart was in knots.
但以天下大事为重，只好冒一冒险。	There's so much that hangs on this though, I just have to take the chance.
7. 开麦拉	Camera
以后她对这件事就失去了兴趣。	After that she lost interest in making love to me.
只见桌上仍是放着许多碟点心，他取了几块吃了，听得靴子声响，只怕来的不是小玄子，心想先钻入桌底再说，却听得小玄子在门外叫道：“小桂子，小桂子！”	The table was piled high again with good things to eat, and this time Trinket tucked in with a vengeance. Then he heard the flip-ploy of cloth boots again. He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty. 'Laurel! Laurel!' It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway.
父亲却永远没达到这种哲学的思维深度。	Father never achieved this degree of philosophical depth.
说到这里，叹了口气，道：“咱们做百姓的，总是死路一条。	He sighed. 'For the common people though, the subjects of Empire, our role is to be the deer.
14.分娩	Childbirth
这个活计很累，连偷懒都不可能，因为猪吃不饱会叫唤。	It was really a tiring job, and impossible to slack off. The pigs would squeal if they didn't get enough food.
这就是一九八五年的王琦瑶。	This was Wang Qiyao in 1985.
陈清扬说，她丝毫也不藐视破鞋。	Chen Qingyang said she didn't look down on damaged goods at all.
这剪尖其实甚钝，小郡主肌肤虽嫩，却也没伤到她丝毫，可是她惊惶之下，只道这小恶人真的用刀子在自己脸上雕花，一阵气急，便晕了过去。	Although she had the most delicate complexion imaginable, the point was so blunt that it made not the slightest mark on her skin; but so great was her fear, that she imagined this horrible boy really was cutting patterns on her face and, from excess of emotion, she fainted clean away.
人家夫妇敦伦，我们无伦可言，只好敦友谊。	Married couples have a code of ethics to strengthen, and we don't have that, so we can only strengthen our friendship.
又说道谁家的戏子好，谁家的花园好，又告诉他谁家的丫头标致，谁家的酒席丰盛，又是谁家有奇货，又是谁家有异物。	He told him which household kept the best troupe of players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets.
乱秧秧的，人家忘了把发的结婚证要回去。 结果陈清扬留了一张。	In the confusion they forgot to take our marriage certificate back, and so Chen Qingyang kept one for herself.
那孩子抓了些泥巴扔我。	The boy grabbed some dirt and flung it at me.
后因曹雪芹于悼红轩中，披阅十载，增删五次，纂成目录，分出章回，又题曰《金陵十二钗》，并题一绝。	Cao Xueqin in his Nostalgia Studio worked on it for ten years, in the course of which he rewrote it no less than five times, dividing it into chapters, composing chapter headings, renaming it The Twelve Beauties of Jinling, and adding an introductory quatrain.
韦小宝乘机跃起，抱住他头颈。	Trinket seized his chance, leapt up, and pinned his opponent down by the throat.
他的少言寡语，也叫他们放心。	The fact that he was taciturn also put them at ease.
你明儿再这么狐媚子，我先打了你，再叫人告诉学里，皮不揭了你的!	And if I have any more of this nonsense from you in future, young man,' she went on to Jia Huan, 'I'll first give you a good hiding myself and then send someone to tell the school about you and see if they can knock a bit of sense into you!
那里的人习惯于把一切不是破鞋的人说成破鞋，而对真的破鞋放任自流。	People there were used to accusing the innocent of being damaged goods, but as for real damaged goods, they just let them do whatever they wanted.
我真名叫作陈永华，永远的永，中华之华。”	It is not my real name. My real name is Chen Yonghua.'
这想象力是龙门能跳狗洞能钻的，一无清规戒律。	With the imagination completely free from all fetters, gossip can leap through the dragon's gate and squeeze through the dog's den.
这已经不是她第一次面对小和尚。	It was not the first time that she faced the little Buddha.
在熙来攘往的人群中，人们甚至难以辨别他们的身影，到哪里才能找到他们呢？	It was not even easy to spot them in the crowd. Where might one go to find such a specimen?
那人只不做声，贾瑞便扯下自己的裤子来，硬帮帮就想顶入。	Throughout all of this not a single sound was uttered by his partner. Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to thrust home his hard and throbbing member.
严家的娘姨是不让随便出来的，又换得勤，所以就连她家娘姨，也像是骄傲的，与人们并不相识。	There was a high turnover among their servants; in any case, they were not permitted to loiter when they went out for errands, so they, too, appeared aloof.
许多事情都是强求不得的。	There are a lot of things in life that simply can't be forced.'
程先生回来时，正好康明逊走，两人在楼梯上擦肩而过，互相看了一眼，也没留下什么印象。	Kang Mingxun was just on his way out as Mr. Cheng came back from work. Passing on the stairs, they exchanged a quick glance but neither left much of an impression on the other.
汪淼按莫尔斯电码努力破译着这些闪烁。	Wang tried to interpret the flickers as Morse code.
最令叶文洁难忘的是那些夜晚。	Most memorable to Ye were the evenings.
我说，你怎知我们有男女关系问题？	I said, How do you know we had a love affair?
天地会的会众多是江湖豪杰，赌钱酗酒，乃是天性，向来不以为非，总舵主也就不再理会，向他凝视片刻，道：“你愿不愿拜我为师？”	Since most members of the Society came from a travelling background in which gambling and drunken brawling were accepted as normal behaviour, the Helmsman was inclined to turn a blind eye on these matters. He looked at Trinket intently for some moments as if trying to make his mind up about something. 'Would you like to be my apprentice?'
这事的起因是这样的：她们医院想提拔她，发现她档案里还有一堆东西。	What occasioned this was: Her hospital wanted to promote Chen Qingyang, but they found this pile of confessions in her dossier.
但是对于格外生性者，就须采取锤骟术，也就是割开阴囊，掏出睾九，一木锤砸个稀烂。	But for extremely wild ones, you have to employ the art of hammer-smashing, which is to cut open their scrotums, take out the balls, and then use a wooden hammer to pulverize them.
事后，她必得鼓动王琦瑶烫头发做衣服，怀着点自我牺牲的精神。	Afterward she would in a self-deprecating tone urge Wang Qiyao to get some new clothes and have her hair permed.
老子就吃过。”	Do try some, it's delicious!'
宝玉笑道：“给你个榧子吃呢!	Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her: 'Put that on your tongue, girl!
我问她，碰上了人家怎么说？	I asked, What would the attendant say if he came in right in the middle of things?
疯狂如同无形的洪水，将城市淹没其中，并渗透到每一个细微的角落和缝隙。	A flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny.
好在他撒谎圆谎的本领着实不小，跟着道：“这老儿奉了鳌拜之命，将我二人擒去，想那鳌拜是个极大的大官，自然不能轻易出手。”	To a practised liar like Trinket, however, this presented little difficulty. The old eunuch was acting on Oboi's orders. I suppose Oboi, being so important, was too grand to do the dirty work himself.'
她听了以后就开始发愣，大概是没有思想准备。	She stared at me blankly after hearing my words—maybe she was not prepared for this.
后来在党的政策感召下，下山弃暗投明。	Only under the influence of our party's policy did we come down the mountain to abandon darkness for sunlight.
“不是故障。”	'It's not a malfunction.'
就去解乳罩。	So she started to undo her bra.
而你脸不黑而且白，乳房不下垂而且高耸，所以你是破鞋。	Now your face is not dark but fair, your breasts are not hanging down but jutting out, so you must be damaged goods.
人活着总要做几件事情，这就是其中之一。	A person had to accomplish a few things in life and this was one of them.
舍我罢！”	Give her to me!'
韦小宝道：“我…… 我觉得你近来…… 近来咳得好了些。”	'Oh, I don't know,' said Trinket, not quite sure where this conversation was heading. 'I thought your cough was getting a bit better lately.'
叶文洁：如果他们能够跨越星际来到我们的世界，说明他们的科学已经发展到相当的高度，一个科学如此昌明的社会，必然拥有更高的文明和道德水准。	YE: If they can cross the distance between the stars to come to our world, their science must have developed to a very advanced stage. A society with such advanced science must also have more advanced moral standards.
爷爷要父亲帮助他挤压伤口。	He told Father to squeeze the area around the wound.
宝玉见他这般病势，又添了这些烦恼，连忙忍气吞声，安慰他仍旧睡下出汗。	Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her condition, Bao-yu stifled his indignation and did his best to comfort her so that she might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever.
这时，齐家屯的一对老人来找基地领导，说他们可以把叶文洁和孩子带回家去照顾。	Just then, an old couple living in Qijiatun came to talk to the base leaders and explained that they could take Ye and her baby home with them and take care of them.
父亲在王文义妻子的尸体上游蹲下，双手掬起水来喝，粘稠的水滴从他的指缝里摇曳下落，落水无声。	He squatted down upriver from the corpse of Wang Wenyi's wife and scooped up some water in his hands; the sticky water oozed through the cracks between his fingers and dropped noiselessly to the ground.
我甚至想到可能中国已经复辟了帝制，军代表已经当上了此地的土司。	I even imagined that the emperor had been restored and the military deputy had become the local chief.
汪淼将箱子放到车座上打开，拿出一副3K眼镜，这东西很像他刚用过的V装具中的头盔显示器。	Wang opened the suitcase on the backseat of his car and took out a pair of 3K glasses. It resembled the display inside the panoramic viewing helmet of the V-suit.
绍琳和两名大学红卫兵无言以对，与中学和社会上的红卫兵不同，他们不可能一点儿道理也不讲。	Shao Lin and the two college student Red Guards had no answer for this. Unlike the Red Guards who were still in junior high school, they couldn't completely ignore logic.
韦小宝哈哈大笑，道：“老乌龟便是海老公，他名字叫作海大富。	Trinket burst out laughing. 'Old Devil is what I used to call the old eunuch Hai-goong—among other things. His real name was Hai Dafu.
可是我偏让她失望。	But I intentionally disappointed her.
但除此以外，这三个三十左右的女人与当年那三名英姿飒爽的红卫兵已没有任何相似之处了，从她们身上消逝的，除了青春，显然还有更多的东西。	Other than the uniforms, the three women in their thirties no longer resembled the three young Red Guards who had looked so valiant on that day. They had lost not only youth, but also something else.
它们是自行其事，你说你的，它说它的，什么样的有公论的事情，在它都是另一番是非。	They mind their own business: whatever others may say, they will stick to their version—to them even settled opinions are taken under advisement.
独臂女人说：“最近有一部电影，叫《枫》，不知你看过没有？	The one-armed woman said, 'There was a movie called Maple recently. I don't know if you've seen it.
这时，有一个轿夫开口说话：“轿上的小娘子，跟哥哥们说几句话呀！	Just then one of the bearers spoke up: 'You there, little bride in the chair, say something!
人家是切菜刀，是砧板，我们就是鱼和肉。	Like meat or fish being sliced up on the chopping-board.
韦小宝见这些人所发暗号各各不同，也不知是何用意。	Trinket observed that the signals they made were all different, but was unable to guess their significance.
大声吆喝：“你睁不睁眼？”	'Open your eyes!' he hollered at the top of his voice.
父亲拖着枪，跟着爷爷，绕着屠杀场走着，滋足了血的黑土像胶泥一样，陷没了他们的脚面。 人的尸体与高粱的残躯混杂在一起。	Father followed Granddad, dragging his rifle behind him as they circled the site of the massacre. The blood-soaked earth had the consistency of liquid clay under the weight of their footsteps; bodies of the dead merged with the wreckage of sorghum stalks.
没有远的目标，近的目标是有的。	And, though he lacked long-term goals, he did have some short-term plans.
理发店门前的三色灯柱旋转着，也是夜景不熄的内心。	The tricolor revolving pole outside the barbershop was the emblem of this unsleeping city.
也到底大家想个方法儿才好。	'But can't we all sit down peaceably and think of a way?
此方人家俱用竹篱木壁，也是劫数应当如此，于是接二连三牵五挂四，将一条街烧得如火焰山一般；彼时虽有军民来救，那火已成了势了，如何救得下? 直烧了一夜方息，也不知烧了多少人家。	And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process.
叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上台。 她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。	Ye's wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd's front row. She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.
刘老老便拉住一个道：“我问哥儿一声：有个周大娘在家么？”	She grabbed a small urchin from their midst and drew him towards her. 'Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?'
莺儿便说：“明明是个么！”	'It was an ace,' said Oriole, 'as plain as anything!'
只是他为人稳重谨慎，既不落款，亦无题跋。	'But you know what a stolid, careful person Erzhan is. He wouldn't sign it and he wouldn't write any inscription.
等王琦瑶最终拗不过她，答应换个日子再去的时候，吴佩珍便像又受了一次恩，欢天喜地去找表哥改日子。	By the time Wang Qiyao finally gave in and agreed to go some other time, Wu Peizhen was acting as if yet another gift that she herself had to be thankful for had been bestowed upon her, and she ecstatically scurried off to find her cousin to change the date.
大史说：“震荡炸弹是我们警方用的玩意儿，确实可以一下子把建筑物里的人震昏，但目前好像只对一两个房间有用。	Da Shi said, 'I use concussion bombs in police work, but they're toys. They're indeed capable of stunning people inside a building into unconsciousness, but they're only good for a room or two.
这东西好像个发怒的眼镜蛇一样立在那里，是不大好看。	Standing there like an angry cobra, the thing was indeed homely.
如今王府虽升了官儿，只怕二姑太太还认的咱们，你为什么不走动走动?	Her brother has been promoted; but I shouldn't be surprised if she at least didn't still remember us. Why don't you try your luck with her?
她就这样走过阳光下的草地，走进了一条干河沟，在河沟里走了很久。	She crossed a sunlit meadow, entered a dry gully, and walked for a long time.
余占鳌走在最后，他猛回转身，双目直逼吃拤饼的人。	Yu Zhan'ao, bringing up the rear, spun around and glared.
上海每一条弄堂里，都有着这样是非的空气。	Every longtang in Shanghai is steeped in an atmosphere of gossip, where right and wrong get twisted and confused.
严师母在此之前就对程先生有好印象，便分外热情，见面就熟。	Madame Yan already had a good impression of Mr. Cheng and was especially friendly toward him; it wasn't long before she felt like they were old friends.
那嘈杂都在底下了，而他们浮了上来，漂流一会儿就会好的。	All the noise and clatter remain below, but they have floated to the top and it feels good to drift for a while.
大凤从来没出过这事儿，她的眼神极好，借着炭火的光也能干细活儿。	Feng, of course, never had this happen to her. She had very sharp eyes, and could do detailed work even in the dim light from heating charcoal.
你们姐夫舅子合伙搞我！	You are ganging up on me!
她第一次要我证明她清白无辜时，我翻了一串白眼，然后开始胡说八道。 第二次她要我证明我们俩无辜，我又一本正经地向她建议举行一次性交。	The first time she wanted me to prove her innocence, I looked up at the ceiling and began to talk nonsense; the next time she wanted me to prove our innocence, I earnestly suggested having intercourse with her.
韦小宝暗暗叫苦：“原来做太监要净身，那就是割去小便的东西。	Trinket was horrified. 'So that's what being 'purified' means: having your piss-pipe and the other bits cut off.
平安里的一日生计，是在喧嚣之中拉开帷幕；粪车的轱辘声，涮马桶声，几十个煤球炉子在弄堂里升烟，隔夜洗的衣衫也晾出来了，竹竿交错，好像在烟幕中升旗。	Mornings, however, begin with night-soil carts, clattering in to collect waste for fertilizer, and the raspy noises of brushes scrubbing out commodes. Amid the smoke of coal burners, laundry soaked overnight is taken out to be hung, banner-like, on bamboo poles.
陈近南见他欲言又止，问道：“你还想说什么？”	Observing that Trinket appeared to be hesitating, the Helmsman asked him if there was something else he wanted to say.
在我看来，这东西无比重要，就如我之存在本身。	To me, the thing was extremely important, as important as my existence itself.
那片场的经验有些出人意料，说不上是扫兴还是尽兴，总之都是疲乏了。	The girls' experience at the film studio was not exactly as expected; it was difficult to say whether it was disappointing or whether they had had the time of their lives—the one thing for sure was that they were both exhausted.
睡觉做爱都不摘下来。	She wouldn't take it off even when she was sleeping or making love to me.
父亲把爷爷拖起来。	Father pulled Granddad to his feet.
这件事离了题，所以就没写。	So the incident seemed beside the point and I didn't write about it.
“审判日”号宽阔的甲板上很空荡，只是后甲板上有一个人在用水龙头冲洗缆桩，汪淼从高处看得很清楚，当船的这一部分从钢柱间移过的瞬间，那人的身体突然僵硬了，水龙头从他手里滑落；与此同时，连接龙头的胶皮水带也在不远处断成两截，水从那里白花花地喷了出来，那人直直地站了几秒钟就倒下了，他的身体在接触甲板的同时分成两截。	Judgment Day's wide deck was empty save for one man standing near the stern hosing down the ship's bollards. From his vantage point, Wang saw everything clearly. The moment that that section of the ship passed between the pillars, the hose broke into two pieces not too far from the man, and water spilled out. The man's body stiffened, and the nozzle tumbled from his hand. He remained standing for a few seconds, then fell. As his body contacted the deck, it came apart in two halves.
他们说，那你还是交待投敌叛变的问题。	They said, A traitorship problem would do.
顾炎武道：“晚村兄豪气干云，令人好生敬佩。 怕的是见不到鞑子皇帝，却死于一般的下贱奴才手里。	'I admire your heroic spirit,' said Gu, 'but I don't think there's much likelihood of your meeting the Tartar Emperor face to face. You would die at the hands of miserable slaves.
很快，队伍钻进了高粱地。 我父亲本能地感觉到队伍是向着东南方向开进的。	The troops turned quickly into the sorghum, and Father knew instinctively that they were heading southeast.
红土的大板块就分外地滑。	The red clay was very slippery.
要说流言的好，便也就在这真里面了。	If gossip has a positive side, it is the part of it that is genuine.
老头坐在小山一样的货物上，像一只狼守护着自己的猎物。	He was sitting on a small mountain of stuff and guarding it as a wolf guards its kill.
韦小宝记得茅十八在酒馆中与七名大汉相斗的手法，突然左手出拳，击向那男孩下颚，砰的一声，正好打中。	Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek.
一面说，一面禁不住流泪，又怕宝玉烦恼，只得又勉强忍着。	She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting Bao-yu.
韦小宝道：“不降！” 欲待挺腰翻起，蓦地里腰间一阵酸麻，后腰两处穴道已被小玄子屈指抵住，那正是海老公昨晚所教的手法，自己虽然学会了，却给对方抢先用出。	'No! Never!' protested Trinket, but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back. Misty had beaten him to it! He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.
说道：“有一点点痛，也没什么有趣。”	But all he said was: 'It hurts a bit. I wouldn't have said it was interesting exactly.'
它们有时候是那样，有时候是这样，莫衷一是的模样。	Unable to decide on any one appearance, they remain fickle, sometimes looking like this, sometimes looking like that.
天黑下来，阳光逐渐红下去。	It was getting darker and the sunlight gradually reddened.
亚热带旱季的阳光把我晒得浑身赤红，痛痒难当，我的小和尚直翘翘地指向天空，尺寸空前。	The sunshine in the subtropical dry season had burned my entire body red, leaving me in an agony of burning and itching. My little Buddha pointed to the sky like an arrow, bigger than ever.
回来的路上扛着她爬坡。	So on the way home I carried her on my shoulder climbing the hills.
众人打量了一会，便问：“是那里来的？”	After looking her up and down for a moment or two, they asked her her business.
我就这样走掉了。	So that was the way I left.
一直到我离开云南，也没人让我交还蓑衣。	Even when I left Yunnan, no one asked me to return the palm-bark rain capes.
斯坦顿上校已经离开了，汪淼拿起了他放在草帽上的望远镜，克服着双手的颤抖观察被“飞刃”切割成四十多片的“审判日”号。	Colonel Stanton had already left. Wang picked up the binoculars he'd left on top of his hat. Overcoming his trembling hands, he observed Judgment Day.
她要走了……	If she leaves . . .
说着又将匕首移近数寸。	While he was saying this he managed to move the dagger a few inches nearer.
幸而天气尚早，人都未起，从后门一径跑回家去。	Fortunately no one was about at that early hour, and he was able to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen.
其实伟大友谊不真也不假，就如世上一切东西一样，你信它是真，它就真下去。 你疑它是假，它就是假的。 我的话也半真不假。 但是我随时准备兑现我的话，哪怕天崩地裂也不退却。	Actually, the great friendship was neither true nor false, like everything else in the world. It was true if you believed it, and false if you didn't; my words were also neither true nor false, but I was prepared to stand by my words anytime and wouldn't back off even if the sky collapsed and the earth cracked open.
她们惴惴的，心想是来错了，吴佩珍更是愧疚有加，不敢看王琦瑶的脸色。	They were both getting anxious, feeling that the whole trip was a mistake. Wu Peizhen could hardly bring herself to look Wang Qiyao in the eye.
它们又辽阔又密实．有些像农人撒播然后丰收的麦田，还有些像原始森林，自生自灭的。	At once dense and wide-ranging, they resemble rye fields where the farmers, having scattered their seeds, are now harvesting a rich crop. Then again, they are a little like a pristine forest, living and dying according to its own cycle.
薛蟠连忙打恭作揖赔不是，又求：“别难为了小子，都是我央及他去的。”	Xue Pan was by this time being apologetic — bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how sorry he was: 'Don't blame the lad!' he said. 'It wasn't his fault. I talked him into it.'
闷来时敛额，行去几回眸。	Yet, as my brow contracted with new care, Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare?
奶奶用亢奋的眼睛，看着余占鳌。	She stared at Yu Zhan'ao with a feverish look in her eyes.
鸽群飞翔时，望着波涛连天的弄堂的屋瓦，心是一刺刺的疼痛。	The pigeons gaze down at the outstretching billows of roof tiles as they take to the air, and their hearts are stabbed with pain.
“爹，咱到村里去吧。”父亲说。	'Let's go into the village, Dad,' Father said.
她曾经盼望着早日成婚，但从女伴的话语中隐隐约约听到单家公子是个麻风病患者，奶奶的心凉了，奶奶向她的父母诉说着心中的忧虑。 外曾祖父遮遮掩掩不回答，外曾祖母把奶奶的女伴们痛骂一顿，其意大概是说狐狸吃不到葡萄就说葡萄是酸的之类。	Eager to marry, she heard innuendos from her girlfriends that the Shan boy was afflicted with leprosy, and her dreams began to evaporate. Yet, when she shared her anxieties with her parents, Great-Granddad hemmed and hawed, while Great-Grandma scolded the girlfriends, accusing them of sour grapes.
我逃跑是晚上的事。	In the evening I made my escape.
“我想观测宇宙背景辐射的整体波动。”	'I want to see the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background.'
留良道：“正是。”	'You are absolutely right,' said Lü.
《汉书》上说：‘秦失其鹿，天下共逐之。’	In the History of the Han Dynasty it says 'Qin lost the deer and the world went chasing after it'.
再看王琦瑶，眼前便有些发虚，焦点没对准似的，恍惚间，他看见了三十多年前的那个影。	His vision grew blurry as he stared at Wang Qiyao, as if his eyes couldn't focus properly, and through that hazy vision he saw an image of her from more than three decades ago.
还使暗淡生辉。	It had the power to make what was dark and dismal glimmer with light.
父亲又想起大约七八年前的一个晚上，我奶奶喝醉了酒，在我家烧酒作坊的院子里，有一个高粱叶子垛，奶奶倚在草垛上，搂住罗汉大爷的肩，呢呢喃喃地说：“大叔…… 你别走。	Then he thought back to a night some seven or eight years earlier, when Grandma, drunk at the time, had stood in the distillery yard beside a pile of sorghum leaves, her arms around Uncle Arhat's shoulders. 'Uncle . . . don't leave,' she pleaded.
奶奶那年身高一米六零，体重六十公斤，上穿碎花洋布褂子，下穿绿色缎裤，脚脖子上扎着深红色的绸带子。	That year Grandma was five feet four inches tall and weighed about 130 pounds. She was wearing a cotton print jacket over green satin trousers, with scarlet bands of silk tied around her ankles.
奶奶身上汗水淋漓。	Grandma was drenched with sweat.
一声枪响。	A shot rang out.
可这个笨蛋还来添乱，在我背上扑腾起来，让我放她下去。	But the idiot picked that moment to give me trouble, flopping around on my back and demanding that I put her down.
程先生也不与她争辩，两人在附近找了个小饭馆，坐进去，点好菜。	Mr. Cheng refused to argue with her. They found a small restaurant nearby, went in, and ordered a few dishes.
但是我偏说，陈清扬就是破鞋，而且这一点毋庸置疑。	Yet I insisted on saying that Chen Qingyang was damaged goods, and that this was beyond question.
陈清扬坐在椅子上听着风声，回想起以往发生的事情，对一切都起了怀疑。	Sitting in a chair and listening to the sound of the wind, Chen Qingyang would look back at what happened and begin to have doubts about everything.
她的光艳照人里有一些天真，也有一些沧桑，杂糅在一起，是哀绝的美。	There was an innocence about her heavy makeup and also a certain world-weariness, blended together to create a desolate kind of beauty.
海老公又道：“你机缘挺好，巴结上了皇上，本来嘛，也可以有一番大大的作为。	'You've got a lucky streak,' the old eunuch continued. 'Getting yourself into the Emperor's graces like that—it could have been very useful.
后来我遇上了勒都。 他告诉我说，他们把那条河岔里的鱼都捉到手了。	After a while, I ran into Le Du, who told me that they had caught all the fish at the fork of the rivers.
但这些细节终不那么真实，浮在面上的，它们刺痛了老克腊的心。	But none of those details looked real; they floated on the surface, piercing Old Colour's heart.
那男孩问道：“你叫什么名字？”	'What's your name?' asked the boy.
吃拤饼的人眼里跳出绿火花，一行行雪白的清明汗珠从他脸上惊惶地流出来。	Green flames seemed to shoot from his eyes, and crystalline beads of sweat scurried down his terrified face.
众人只得带进那道士来。	The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the bedroom.
“我看没必要在这个警察身上浪费时间。”	'I don't think we need to waste time on this policeman,'
老克腊走在马路上，有风迎面吹来。 是从楼缝中挤过来的变了形的风，他看上去没什么声色，心却是活跃的，甚至有些歌舞的感觉。	As Old Colour walked down the street, the wind blowing against his face was a draft squeezed through the space between two buildings. He may have looked calm on the surface, but his heart was vibrant, almost dancing with joy.
一见宝玉在前，便站住了，笑道：“二叔叔在家里呢，我只当出门去了呢。”	Seeing his uncle ahead of him, he stood politely to attention and greeted him cheerfully: 'Hello, Uncle. I didn't know you were at home. I thought you'd gone out.'
正想着，只听里面隔着纱窗子笑说道：“快进来罢！	A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements: 'Come on in!
鸡巴！	You pricks!
那十三人大喜，飞身上马，向前疾奔。	The thirteen men, with rapturous expressions on their faces, dashed to the ready-waiting horses, jumped into the saddle, and galloped away.
医院里没人听说过王二，更没人知道他上哪儿去了。	No one in the hospital had ever heard of Wang Er, so nobody knew where he had gone.
我听了这话，几乎要朝他肚子上打一枪。	When I heard this, I felt the urge to fire at his belly.
假如当初我退回山上去，这样的事就会发生。	If I had returned to the mountains then, that would have happened.
一时贾家众人齐来吊问。	The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to offer their condolences.
尹兄弟后继有人，青木堂有主儿了。”	It gives Brother Yin a successor and the Green Wood Lodge a Master.'
程先生就又高兴起来，盘算着炒几个菜，烧什么汤，王琦瑶总是与他唱反调，把他的计划推翻再重来。	That was enough to put Mr. Cheng back in high spirits. He pondered what kind of soup and dishes they should serve. Wang Qiyao objected to virtually every one of his suggestions, and he had to start from scratch.
刘老老道：“我也知道。	'I knew all about that,' said Grannie Liu.
阳光从前边人家的屋顶上照进窗口，在地板上划下一方一方的。	The sun, reflected from the rooftops across the alley, left rectangles of light on the wooden floor.
我确实去过境外。	I did cross the border.
可是她走进草房，看到王二就坐在床上，小和尚直挺挺，却吓得尖叫起来。	But as she entered the hut and saw Wang Er sitting on the bed, his little Buddha stiff, she was frightened into screaming.
他们以为我们跑到缅甸去了。	They believed we had run off to Burma.
这就是他与改变世界的科学大师唯一的一次交流，没有物理学，没有相对论，只有冰冷的现实。	This was the only time he spoke with the great scientist who changed the world. There was no discussion of physics, of relativity, only cold, harsh reality.
死活凭我去罢了!	Why can't you just leave me here to die in peace?
现在没关系了。	Now it didn't matter anymore.
“你还在教学中散布宇宙大爆炸理论，这是所有科学理论中最反动的一个！”	'You also taught the big bang theory. This is the most reactionary of all scientific theories.'
三天后，又有七个孩子来找叶文洁，除了上次来过的三个外，其他四个都是从更远的村镇来的。	Three days later, seven children came to seek Ye. In addition to the three who had come last time, there were four more from villages located even farther away.
于是，红静就和另外三个知青跳下河去捞羊，那时还是凌汛，水面上还浮着一层冰呢！	And so, Hongjing and three other students jumped into the river to save the sheep. It was early spring, and the surface of the river was still covered by a thin layer of ice.
“那就是说，”大史吐出一口烟，“得想法让那船白天过运河。”	'In other words, we have to make sure the ship crosses during the day,' Da Shi said, blowing out another mouthful of smoke.
爷爷纵身跳上货堆，飞起一脚，把那老头踢到货堆下。	Granddad jumped up onto the mountain of stuff and, with a single kick, sent the old man sprawling onto the ground.
叶文洁终于还是没有做出一个天体物理学家的回答，她只是说：“它们都很远很远，掉不下来的。”	Ye did not give her the answer of an astrophysicist. She only said, 'They're very, very far away. They can't fall.'
我听说奶奶会吸大烟但不上瘾，所以始终面如桃花，神清气爽，用螃蟹喂过的罂粟花朵肥硕壮大，粉、红、白三色交杂，香气扑鼻。	Apparently Grandma was an opium smoker, but wasn't addicted, which was why she had the complexion of a peach, a sunny disposition, and a clear mind. The crab-nourished poppies grew huge and fleshy, a mixture of pinks, reds, and whites that assailed your nostrils with their fragrance.
她就爬起来说，不行，这样两个人都要病。	So she sat up and said, Enough. Both of us will get sick this way.
那人的上半部分还在血泊中爬行，但只能用两只半条的手臂爬，因为他的手臂也被切断了一半。	The top half crawled through the expanding pool of blood, but had to use two arms that were bloody stumps. The hands had been cleanly sliced off.
程先生早一天就把王琦瑶的母亲接来，在沙发上安了一张铺，还很细心地准备了洗漱用具。	Mr. Cheng had fetched Wang Qiyao's mother the day before, setting up a place for her on the sofa, and even going to the trouble of preparing a set of toiletries.
大楼顶上出现了一个娇小的身影，那个美丽的女孩子挥动着一面“四·二八”的大旗，她的出现立刻招来了一阵杂乱的枪声，射击的武器五花八门，有陈旧的美式卡宾枪、捷克式机枪和三八大盖，也有崭新的制式步枪和冲锋枪——后者是在“八月社论”发表之后从军队中偷抢来的——连同那些梭标和大刀等冷兵器，构成了一部浓缩的近现代史……	The slender figure of a beautiful young girl emerged at the top of the building, waving the giant red banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. Her appearance was greeted immediately by a cacophony of gunshots. The weapons attacking her were a diverse mix: antiques such as American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People's Liberation Army rifles and submachine guns, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the 'August Editorial'; and even a few Chinese dadao swords and spears. Together, they formed a condensed version of modern history.
凌晨时村外一声枪响，把正在梦中与我奶奶厮打的二奶奶惊醒了。	EARLY-MORNING GUNFIRE beyond the village startled Second Grandma out of a dream in which she was fighting Grandma tooth and nail.
于是他们把陈清扬也叫到人保组，严加审讯。	So they took Chen Qingyang to the office, interrogating her severely.
王琦瑶当然也不会认真，只是有点喜欢自己和阮玲玉的相像。	Wang Qiyao naturally did not take him too seriously, but she did kind of like being compared to Ruan Lingyu.
将她抱起，坐在椅上，说道：“你瞧着，我在你身上各个部位指点，倘若指得对的，你就眨三下眼睛，指得不对，眼睛睁得大大的，一动也不能动。	He lifted her up in his arms and sat her down in a chair. 'Now look,' he said, 'I'm going to start pointing to places on your body. If I point to the right place, blink three times; if it isn't right, just keep your eyes open and don't move.
人保组的老郭死乞白咧地说要买，可是只肯出五十块钱。	Old Guo from the public security section promised shamelessly to buy it, but he only wanted to pay fifty yuan.
在夏夜的屋顶上，躺着看星空的其实不止一个孩子，他们心里都是有些鼓荡，不知要往哪里去，就来到屋顶。	And Old Colour certainly wasn't the only one stargazing from the rooftop on those summer nights; the hearts of all these people are restless and unsure of where to go—and so up they go to the rooftops.
那贾芸嘴里和宝玉说话，眼睛却瞅那丫鬟：	Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she approached, but his eyes were on her.
贾芸笑道：“总是我没造化，偏又遇着叔叔欠安。	Jia Yun returned his smile: 'Let's just say that it wasn't my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since then, Uncle Bao.
至脂砚斋抄阅再评，仍用《石头记》。	Red Inkstone restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of annotations to it.
相比之下，康明逊倒显得拘谨和沉默，也不大吃菜，只是喝温热的黄酒，一瓶黄酒很快喝完了，又开了一瓶。	Kang Mingxun, on the other hand, was stiff and subdued. He said little, focusing on the warm rice wine. They finished off the first bottle rather quickly and started on a second.
“打倒反动学术权威叶哲泰！！”	'Down with reactionary academic authority Ye Zhetai!'
陈清扬猛烈地挣扎，流着眼泪，但是没有动手。	She struggled violently to break free, tears rolling down from her eyes, but she didn't slap me.
韦小宝道：“不用想，你有什么规矩，我守着便是。	'I don't need to think,' said Trinket. 'Whatever your rules are, I'll keep them.
同时她揪住乳头往下拉，以示耷拉之状。	Meanwhile, she pulled her breasts down by the nipples to show me where they would reach.
她说，这样刺激性欲。	She said this would arouse her.
她指点他们去最近处的医院，再回楼上，却怎么也睡不着了。	After giving them directions to the nearest hospital, she went back upstairs but could not sleep a wink.
忽然她冷冰冰他说： “喂！ 你知道自己在干什么吗？”	Again I heard her cold voice, 'Hey, do you know what you're doing?'
贾瑞听了，如得珍宝，忙问道：“你别哄我。	Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly jewel. 'Are you sure you're not joking?' he asked hurriedly.
这里不好，到别处玩去。	'If you don't like it here, why don't you go somewhere else?
她第一眼见王琦瑶，心中便暗暗惊讶，她想，这女人定是有些来历。	The first time she saw Wang Qiyao, she was taken aback.
陈清扬说，她女儿已经上了大二，最近知道了我们的事，很想见我。	Chen Qingyang said her daughter had gone into her sophomore year at the university. Recently she found out about our affair and wanted to meet me.
炎武兄眼见事势紧急，忙瞩伊璜先生家人连夜躲避；想起伊璜先生和晚村兄交好，特来探访。”	In view of the urgency, Yanwu advised the family to make their getaway as soon as it was dark. Then, remembering that Yihuang was a good friend of yours, we thought we'd come and look for him here, '
潘寒露出神秘的笑容说：“不错，但假如构成计算机的三千万个士兵，每个人在一秒钟内可以挥动黑白小旗十万次，总线上的轻骑兵的奔跑速度是几倍音速甚至更快，结果就不一样了。	Pan gave a mysterious smile. 'You're right. But suppose that of the thirty million soldiers forming the computer, each one is capable of raising and lowering the black and white flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster. Then the result would be very different.
他从来没这样狼狈过，高密东北乡吹唢吶的好手从来没这样狼狈过。	The great woodwind player of Northeast Gaomi Township had never been in such a mess.
于是走到东边这间屋里，乃是贾琏的女儿睡觉之所。	From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in which Jia Lian's baby daughter slept.
不看僧面看佛面，不看鱼面看水面，不看我的面子也要看豆官的面子上，留下吧，你要我…… 我也给你…… 你就像我的爹一样……”	'If not for the sake of the monk, stay for the Buddha. If not for the sake of the fish, stay for the water. If not for my sake, stay for little Douguan. You can have me, if you want. . . . You're like my own father. . . .'
爷爷的思想当时麻木地凝滞在一个点上，这一点或许是一张扭歪的脸，或许是一管断裂的枪、一颗飞躜着的尖头子弹。	At that moment, Granddad looked benumbed; his thoughts were riveted on a single point, which might have been a twisted face, or a shattered rifle, or a single spent bullet.
我师意为如何？”	What does your reverence say to that?'
囚车旁一清兵恼了，伸腿在车上踢了一脚，喝道：“再哭，再哭！	One of the soldiers marching alongside, irritated by the baby's crying, aimed a mighty kick at the cart. 'Stop it! Shut up!
我整天一声不吭。 陈清扬也一声不吭。	I stayed mute all day long, and so did Chen Qingyang.
爷爷从黑土大地上捡起我奶奶亲手制造的拤饼，大口吞吃，焦黄的牙齿上，沾着饼屑和一个个血泡沫。	He picked up one of Grandma's fistcakes from the dark earth, bit off a chunk, and swallowed it. Cake crumbs and flecks of bubbly blood stuck to his stained teeth.
我站在地上，她用腿圈着我的腰。	I stood on the ground, and she locked her legs around my waist.
韦小宝惊惶之下，终于撒出尿来，从裤裆里一滴一滴的往下直流，幸好海老公没留神，就算听到了，也道是蕊初吓得撒尿。	Trinket was so frightened that he lost control of his bladder and piss soaked through his trousers and began falling drip after drip on the ground. Fortunately the faint sound it made was not detected by the old eunuch; or if it was, he must have assumed that it was the little maid of honour who was wetting herself.
我和陈清扬做爱时，一只蜥蜴从墙缝里爬了进来，走走停停地经过房中间的地面。	When I made love to Chen Qingyang, a lizard crawled out of a crack in the wall and crossed the ground in the middle of the room, moving intermittently.
那坠儿见问，便一桩桩的都告诉他了。	Trinket seemed to have no objection, however, and answered each question as it came.
她家先生一九四九年前是一爿灯泡厂的厂主，公私合营后做了副厂长，照严家师母的话， 就是摆摆样子的。	Her husband had owned a light bulb factory that, since 1949, was jointly operated with the state. He was now the deputy manager—a mere figurehead, according to Madame Yan.
听了这话，我笑起来。	After hearing this, I laughed.
于是她用和解的口气说：不管怎么说，这东西丑得要命，你承不承认？	So to make peace, she softened her tone and said, 'Anyway, he is breathtakingly ugly—don't you agree?'
因此，他们无名无姓的，默默耕耘着自己的一方田地。	And so they remained nameless, silently tilling their little plot of land.
他奶奶的，沐公爷手下，只怕真有几个厉害人物，不可不防。	There are some really dangerous people among that Mu lot, you can't afford to take any chances.
在大学四年中，阮老师一直是她的班主任，也是她最亲密的朋友。	Throughout the four years of Wenjie's college life, Professor Ruan had been her advisor and her closest friend.
宝玉笑道：“你学惯了，明儿连你还咬起来呢。”	'You'd better not imitate her,' said Bao-yu. 'It'll get to be a habit. You'll be lisping yourself before you know where you are.'
沙瑞山又搬出一台笔记本电脑，手忙脚乱地启动系统，插上宽带网线，然后打电话—— 汪淼听出他在联系乌鲁木齐射电观测基地——然后等待着。	Sha took out a notebook computer and rushed to turn it on. He plugged in a network cable and picked up the phone. Wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he was trying to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory.
只觉天涯茫茫，到处是鞑子的天下，真无一片干净土地，沉吟道：“桃源何处，可避暴秦？	The whole world belonged to the Tartars now, it seemed. Not a single patch of land was free of their hated presence. He thought of the poet Tao Yuanming's story about the fisherman who, by following a stream that flowed between flowering peach trees, had stumbled on an earthly paradise—a place where refugees from ancient tyranny had found a haven.
这一切都做得那么得体，那么熟练，那么恰到好处。	Everything was done with skill, practice, and the appropriate level of care.
有时你会觉着那里比较嘈杂，推开窗便噪声盈耳，你不要怪它，这就是简约人生聚沙成塔的动静。 他们毕竟是活泼泼的，也是要有些声响的。	On occasion you might feel that it is rather noisy—as soon as the windows were opened, your ears would be assaulted by all kinds of sounds. But don't be offended: what you hear are the accumulated sounds of the activities of prudent people over their lifetime; at least the noise shows that they are lively.
突然心想：“满洲武士打不过茅大哥，茅大哥又不是老乌龟的对手，何不骗得老乌龟教我些本事？”	Suddenly a thought occurred to him. 'The wrestlers were no match for Whiskers; but Whiskers was no match for Old Turtle-head—why don't I get him to teach me a few moves?'
他听到我曾外祖父舌头僵硬地说：“闺女…… 你…… 一泡尿尿了这半天……	He heard Great-Granddad, whose tongue had grown thick in his mouth, say: 'Daughter . . . you . . . what took you so long to take a piss? . . .
王文义用白布捂着血耳朵，满脸哭相。	Wang Wenyi, on the other hand, wore a crestfallen look as he held the cloth to his injured ear.
阿伧族的女人都很漂亮，身上挂了很多铜箍和银钱。	Ahcang women were all very pretty, their bodies adorned with many bronze bracelets and necklaces and silver coins.
晚村兄何不便题诗一首，将二瞻先生之意，表而出之？”	Why don't you do an inscription, Liuliang — a poem that will give voice to what Erzhan had in mind to say?'
这时，她倒平静下来，心情也松弛了，等那化妆师结束工作走开时，她甚至还生出几分幽默感同吴佩珍开玩笑。 吴佩珍说她简直像是嫦娥下凡，她就说嫦娥也是月饼盒上的嫦娥，于是两人都笑。	It was then that she began to calm down and her tensions eased. By the time the makeup man finished his job, she had even started to regain her sense of humor and joked around a bit with Wu Peizhen, who remarked that Wang Qiyao looked like the Lady in the Moon descending into the secular world, whereupon Wang Qiyao quipped that if she were a Lady in the Moon, she was the kind whose image was found on boxes of mooncakes. The two of them had a good laugh.
一已开进门去，院子是浅的，客堂也是浅的，三步两步便走穿过去，一道木楼梯挡在了头顶。	But, upon entering, one discovers that the courtyard is modest and the reception area narrow—two or three steps and you are already at the wooden staircase across the room.
打过之后我就不管别的事，继续往山上攀登。	After that I cared about nothing else but continuing to climb the mountain.
对她来说，我就是那个急匆匆从山上赶下去的背影，一个记忆中的人。	To her, I was the precise image of someone seen from behind, hurrying down the mountain, a man in her memory.
士隐见女儿越发生得粉装玉琢，乖觉可喜，便伸手接来抱在怀中斗他玩耍一回， 又带至街前，看那过会的热闹。	Her delicate little pink-and-white face seemed dearer to him than ever at that moment, and he stretched out his arms to take her and hugged her to him. After playing with her for a while at his desk, he carried her out to the front of the house to watch the bustle in the street.
一面方方正正的太阳旗在通红的朝霞下耷拉着，一柄柄刺刀上汪着葱绿色的光彩。	A Rising Sun flag drooped under the bright-red sunrise; onion-green rays glinted off a line of bayonets.
我是个什么东西儿!	What sort of creature do you take me for?
走上公路后，父亲顿时感到身体灵巧轻便，脚步利索有劲，他松开了抓住余司令衣角的手。	Once he stepped onto the highway, Father felt suddenly light and nimble; with extra spring in his step, he let go of Commander Yu's coat.
“还有别的更可行的方案吗？”	'Anyone got a better idea?'
知青们说放狗屁，谁偷东西，你们当场拿住了吗？	The city students said, That's bullshit! Who stole your chickens and dogs? Did you catch us in the act?
阮雯端坐在写字台前的那把转椅上，安详地闭着双眼。	Ruan was sitting on the chair before her desk, her eyes closed.
汪淼问，但旋即有些后悔，仔细想着自己的问题是否露出了些许的敌意。	Wang immediately regretted the question. He wondered whether asking it sounded hostile.
那种有前客堂和左右厢房里的流言是要老派一些的，带薰衣草的气味的；而带亭子间和拐角楼梯的弄堂房子的流言则是新派的，气味是樟脑丸的气味。	The kind of gossip exchanged in the front rooms and adjoining wings belongs to the old school and smacks faintly of potpourri. The gossip in the rooftop tingzijian and staircases is new school and smells of mothballs.
再有那山墙上的爬墙虎，隔壁洋房里的钢琴声，都是怀旧的养料。	Besides these, the ivy crawling up the sides of the walls and the sounds of someone playing the piano in the Western-style house next door also came to feed their nostalgia.
只是父亲、伯叔、兄弟之伦，因是圣人遗训，不敢违忤，所以弟兄间亦不过尽其大概就罢了，并不想自己是男子，须要为子弟之表率。	Only in the case of his father, uncles and brother, where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception – and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan.
第三次来找她的孩子是十五个，同来的还有一位镇中学的老师，由于缺人，他物理、数学和化学都教，他来向叶文洁请教一些教学上的问题。	The third time, fifteen children came to find her, and even a teacher at a small-town high school came along. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he had to teach physics, math, and chemistry, and he came to ask Ye for some help on teaching.
从这些体会里我得到一个结论，就是永远别让别人注意你。	I drew a conclusion from these experiences: never let other people pay attention to you!
此时她想和我交谈，正如那时节她渴望和外面的世界合为一体，溶化到天地中去。	She wanted to talk to me at that moment, just as she longed to merge with the outside world, to dissolve into the sky and the earth.
太阳是从屋顶上喷薄而出，坎坎坷坷的，光是打折的光，这是由无数细碎集合而成的壮观，是由无数耐心集合而成的巨大的力。	Coming up over the longtang rooftops, the sun shoots out its belabored rays—a majestic sight pieced together from countless minute fragments, an immense power born of immeasurable patience.
别人说我不是哑巴，他始终不敢相信，因为他从来没听我说过一句话。	People told him that I wasn't a mute. He couldn't be sure since he had never heard me speak a single word.
咱们明日便去扬州，二位少坐，兄弟去告知拙荆，让她收拾收拾。”	'We leave for Yangzhou tomorrow, then. If the two of you will just sit here for a moment, I'll go and tell my wife to start getting things ready.'
阮雯曾留学剑桥，她的家曾对叶文洁充满了吸引力，那里有许多从欧洲带回来的精致的书籍、油画和唱片，一架钢琴；还有一排放在精致小木架上的欧式烟斗，父亲那只就是她送的，这些烟斗有地中海石楠根的，有土耳其海泡石的，每一个都仿佛浸透了曾将它们拿在手中和含在嘴里深思的那个男人的智慧，但阮雯从未提起过他。	Ruan had studied at Cambridge University, and her home had once fascinated Wenjie: refined books, paintings, and records brought back from Europe; a piano; a set of European-style pipes arranged on a delicate wooden stand, some made from Mediterranean briar, some from Turkish meerschaum. Each of them seemed suffused with the wisdom of the man who had once held the bowl in his hand or clamped the stem between his teeth, deep in thought, though Ruan had never mentioned the man's name. The pipe that had belonged to Wenjie's father had in fact been a gift from Ruan.
但是人家经常不肯站住，而是加快了脚步。	They didn't stop but sped up.
二十年前，他们看承你们还好，如今是你们拉硬屎，不肯去就和他，才疏远起来。	Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very good to you folk. It's only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to approach them that they have become more distant with you.
可是陈清扬又从山上跑下来找我。	But Chen Qingyang came down the mountain again to see me.
“运河有多宽？	'How wide is the canal?
我们在饭店里，后来也是这么重温伟大友谊。	Later in the hotel room, we relived our great friendship in the same way.
只因尚未酬报灌溉之德，故甚至五内郁结着一段缠绵不尽之意， 常说：‘自己受了他雨露之惠，我并无此水可还。	The consciousness that she owed the stone something for his kindness in watering her began to prey on her mind and ended by becoming an obsession. ''I have no sweet dew here that I can repay him with,' she would say to herself.
爷爷面色阴沉地说。	Granddad's face clouded.
总舵主道：“你要入会，倒也可以。 只是我们干的是反清复明的大事，以汉人的江山为重，自己的身家性命为轻。	'If you want to be a member you can,' said the Helmsman, 'only you must remember that this is a very important business we are engaged in. We have to put our country first, even before our lives.
正说着，只见袭人走来，说道：“快回去穿衣裳去罢，老爷叫你呢。”	Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up: 'Quick!' she said. 'You must come back and change. The Master wants to see you.'

吕留良道：“他…… 他却没有来。	'No, ' said Lü, 'no, he's not here.
原来这小小之家，姓王，乃本地人氏，祖上也做过一个小小京官，昔年曾与凤姐之祖王夫人之父认识。	Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts. A grandfather had held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted with Wang Xi-feng's grandfather, the father of Lady Wang.
一面哭，一面下床来，往外就走。	She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside.
你说什么？	What are you talking about?
国家兴亡，匹夫有责，暂时避祸则可，但若去躲在桃花源里，逍遥自在，忍令亿万百姓在鞑子铁蹄下受苦，于心何安？	The citizen of a conquered country still has his duty. It's all very well to take temporary refuge, but to live a life of ease in some Peach Tree Haven while millions are suffering under the iron heel of the Tartars would be less than human.
她说，年纪大了，里面有点薄，你别那么使劲。	She said, An older woman's insides get a bit thin, don't push too hard.
这阴沉气有时是东西厢房的薰衣草气味，有时是樟脑丸气味，还有时是肉砧板上的气味。	This murky air sometimes smells like lavender in a bedroom, sometimes like mothballs, and at other times like a kitchen chopping block.
高粱棵子里似乎有痛苦的呻吟声，尸体堆中好像有活物的蠕动，父亲想唤住爷爷，去看看这些尚未死利索的乡亲。 他仰起脸来，看到爷爷那副绿锈斑斑、丧失了人的表情的青铜面孔，把话儿压进了喉咙。	Tortured moans emerged from the field of sorghum, and here and there among the bodies some movement appeared. Father was burning to ask Granddad to save those fellow villagers who were still alive, but when he saw the pale, expressionless look on his father's bronze face, the words stuck in his throat.
“下轿！”	'Climb down, I said!'
斯坦顿上校说：“那么中子弹呢？”	Colonel Stanton asked, 'What about a neutron bomb?'

上门打针的人川流不息，今天去了明天来，常有新人出现。	People came to Wang Qiyao in an unending parade. Those who stopped coming were quickly replaced by others.
汪淼钻进车子，离开了天文馆，在城市里漫无目的地开着。	Wang ducked back into the car and left the planetarium.
你没净身，我给你净了也不打紧，只不过，唉，迟了，迟了。”	You haven't been purified, of course, but that's no problem. I could have done the cutting for you. Ah, it's a pity. Too late. Just too late.'
这次试镜头变成她们两人的伤心事，都怀有一些失败感的。	The screen test became a source of sorrow for both of them, leaving them with a deep sense of defeat.
她热情地接待了叶文洁母女，关切地询问她这些年是怎么过来的，惊叹冬冬是多么的聪明可爱，细致入微地对做饭的保姆交代叶文洁喜欢吃的菜……	She enthusiastically welcomed Ye and Dong Dong, inquired after Ye's life during those years with concern, exclaimed that Dong Dong was so cute and smart, and meticulously directed the cook in preparing Ye's favorite dishes.
这样的热点遍布整座城市，像无数并行运算的CPU，将“文革大革命”联为一个整体。	Battles like this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CPUs working in parallel, their combined output, the Cultural Revolution.

他又请她跳舞，她略迟疑一下，接受了。	He asked her to dance. She hesitated for a moment . . . and accepted.

我说：我不会讲汉话哟！	I said, I'm hopeless at speaking Mandarin.
街道和楼房凸现在它之上，是一些点和线，而它则是中国画中称为皴法的那类笔触，是将空白填满的。	Streets and buildings emerge around them in a series of dots and lines, like the subtle brushstrokes that bring life to the empty expanses of white paper in a traditional Chinese landscape painting.
她说，这一切都是因为我在河边的小屋里谈到伟大友谊。	She said all that happened came about because I talked about great friendship in my small house by the river.
说着出屋而去。	And with that he left the room.
韦小宝倒拿她没有法子，说道：“你不睁眼，我偏偏要你睁眼，咱哥儿俩耗上了，倒要瞧瞧是你郡主娘娘厉害，还是我这小流氓、小叫化子厉害。	Trinket was at his wit's end to know what to do with her. 'You don't want to open your eyes but I want you to open them,' he said. 'All right, we'll play a little game and see who comes out best, the high and mighty Little Countess or the nasty little beggar-boy.
小玄子笑道：“学摔交就是学拗人手臂，什么不要脸了？”	That's what wresding's all about!' laughed Misty. 'Who says it's not fair!'

所以春天我去插秧，撅在地里像一根半截电线杆，秋收后我又去放牛，吃不上热饭。	That was why in the spring I had to plant rice seedlings, stooped over in the field like a broken electricity pole; in the autumn I had to herd cattle, so I couldn't get a hot meal.

怎么不借给温家哥儿俩？”	You could at least have lent to one of the Wen brothers!'
他拿起一副走到车外戴上，透过镜片看到的城市夜景没有变化，只是暗了些，这时他才想起要将开关打开，立刻，城市化作一团团朦胧的光晕，大部分亮度固定，还有一些闪烁或移动着。	He put the glasses on and looked around. The city looked the same as before, only dimmer. Then he remembered that he had to switch them on. The city turned into many hazy glowing halos. Most were fixed, but a few flickered or moved.
过了好久，她才将悬空的手臂放下来，缓缓起身走上台，坐在父亲的遗体边，握起他的一只已凉下来的手，两眼失神地看着远方。	After a long time, she finally let her arms down, walked slowly onto the stage, sat next to her father's body, and held one of his already-cold hands, her eyes staring emptily into the distance.
汪淼看着右岸的人利索地抽回连接纳米丝的普通钢丝，把已经绷紧的纳米丝在钢柱上固定好。	Wang watched as those on the eastern shore rapidly winched back the steel wires attached to the nanofilaments and secured the tightened nanofilaments to the pillar.
不管怎么说，他不能把我阉掉，也不能把陈清扬拉走。	At any rate, he couldn't castrate me, or take Chen Qingyang as his concubine.
他迷迷糊糊的睡了一会，悄悄起身，把那盒蜜饯糕饼揣在怀里，生怕惊醒海老公，慢慢一步步的蹑足而出，走到门边，轻轻拔开了门闩，再轻轻打开了一扇门，突然听得海老公问道：“小桂子，你去哪里？”	After sleeping fitfully for what must have been several hours, he got up silently, stuffed the box of cakes inside his breast pocket,and made his way on tiptoe across the room, pausing at each step for fear the old eunuch might waken. Then, slowly and gently, he slid back the door-bar and opened one of the leaves of the door. At that very moment he heard the old eunuch's voice calling out from behind him. 'Laurie, where are you going?'
爷爷说：“老子不是八路，也不是九路。	'I'm not with the Eighth Route Army,' Granddad said, 'or the Ninth Route.
不远处永远有一个工地，彻夜的灯光，电力打夯机的声音充满在夜空底下，有节律地涌动着。	Not far off there would always be a construction site, where the lights blazed through the night and the noise of pile-drivers, hammering away in rhythm, filled the entire space below the heavens.
黛玉坐在床上，一面抬手整理鬓发，一面笑向宝玉道：“人家睡觉，你进来做什么？”	'What do you mean by coming into people's rooms when they're asleep?' said Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed's edge patting her hair into shape.
夜色灰葡萄，金风串河道，宝蓝色的天空深邃无边，绿色的星辰格外明亮。 北斗勺子星——北斗主死，南斗簸箕星——南斗司生、八角玻璃井——缺了一块砖，焦灼的牛郎要上吊，忧愁的织女要跳河…… 都在头上悬着。	On that grey-purple night a golden breeze followed the course of the river. The sapphire-blue sky was deep and boundless, green-tinted stars shone brightly in the sky: the ladle of Ursa Major (signifying death), the basket of Sagittarius (representing life); Octans, the glass well, missing one of its tiles; the anxious Herd Boy (Altair), about to hang himself; the mournful Weaving Girl (Vega), about to drown herself in the river. . . .
韦小宝大喜，来不及装饭，夹起一块红烧肉便吃，虽然菜肴早已冷了，吞入饥肠，却是说不出的美味，心想：“这些饭菜不知是谁送来的。	Trinket was delighted, and without bothering to fill his bowl with rice, he attacked a dish of stewed meat. The food was cold, but he was hungry, and to him it was indescribably delicious. 'I wonder where they get the food from?
总舵主，你如许我入会，我可快活死啦。”	If you'll let me join, Helmsman, I'll be the happiest boy in the world.'
他根本没有听清斯坦顿在说什么，世界的其余部分对他来说已经不存在，他的全部注意力都集中到还没有在视野中出现的“审判日”号上。	He wasn't listening to Stanton at all. The rest of the world had ceased to exist for him. All of his attention was focused on the spot where Judgment Day would appear.
那天晚上我没走掉。 陈清扬把我拽住，以伟大友谊的名义叫我留下来。	I did not leave that night—Chen Qingyang caught me and asked me to stay in the name of our great friendship.
田野里早已清静无人，在那个年头里，凡能吃上口饭的庄稼人都是早早地回家，不敢恋晚，一到夜间，高粱地就成了绿林响马的世界。	The fields were still and deserted. During those years, any farmer who had food at home left his field before nightfall, turning the sorghum fields into a haven for bandits.
各位，时间很紧，我们必须以最高效率工作。”	Time is of the essence, and we must work efficiently.

两人在电影院里见面，看一场农民翻身的电影，是王琦瑶最不要看的那种，硬撑到底的。	Arrangements were made for them to meet at a theater to watch a movie about victorious peasants—the kind of thing she detested—but she forced herself to sit through it.
我就一头倒下去，扑到竹板床上，几乎把床砸塌。 我的腰痛得厉害，完全不能打弯。	I threw myself headlong onto the bamboo bed and nearly crushed it—my lower back hurt so much that I simply could not bend.

因此一事，就勾出多少风流冤家都要下凡，造历幻缘，那绛珠仙草也在其中。	'Because of this strange affair, Disenchantment has got together a group of amorous young souls, of which Crimson Pearl is one, and intends to send them down into the world to take part in the great illusion of human life.
一面即到自己房中更衣洗濯。 心下方想到凤姐玩他，因此发一回狠；再想想凤姐的模样儿标致，又恨不得一时搂在怀里。	Then rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed, his mind running all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him. The thought of her trickery provoked a surge of hatred in his soul; yet even as he hated her, the vision of her loveliness made him long to clasp her to his breast.
韦小宝道：“今儿我赌了钱回来，遇到一个小…… 小太监，拦住了路，要我分钱给他，我不肯，他就跟我比武，说道我胜得过他，才放我走。	'Well, after today's game, I met this . . . little eunuch, who stood in my way and asked me to give him some of my winnings. I wouldn't, so we ended up fighting.

当即说道：“公公，你要我去上书房拿几本书，这中间却有一桩难处。”	He asked the old eunuch at once: 'Goong-goong, if you want me to go stealing books from the Upper Library, there's just one problem.'
爷爷说：“豆官，咱们…… 找你娘去吧……”	'Douguan,' he said, 'let's go find your mother. . . .'
吴佩珍本来对片厂没有多少准备，她的向往是因王琦瑶而生的向往，她自然是希望片厂越精彩越好，可究竟是什么样的精彩，心中却是没数的，所以她是要看王琦瑶的态度再决定她的意见。	Wu Peizhen had never had her sights set on the studio. Her reason for going rested entirely in making Wang Qiyao happy, so naturally she had hoped it would be a wonderful trip. Just what was so wonderful about the film studio, however, Wu Peizhen had not the slightest clue—she had to wait for Wang Qiyao's reaction to find out.
依我说，你竟家去住两日，请一个大夫来瞧瞧，吃两剂药，就好了。”	'If you ask me, I think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some medicine.'
这段记忆被浓缩成一幅幅欧洲古典油画，很奇怪，不是中国画，就是油画，中国画上空白太多，但齐家屯的生活是没有空白的，像古典的油画那样，充满着浓郁得化不开的色彩。	This period condensed in her memory into a series of classical paintings—not Chinese brush paintings but European oil paintings. Chinese brush paintings are full of blank spaces, but life in Qijiatun had no blank spaces. Like classical oil paintings, it was filled with thick, rich, solid colors.
如今太太不理事，都是琏二奶奶当家。	Nowadays Her Ladyship doesn't run things here any longer. It's Master Lian's wife who does all the managing –
其时是八点钟左右，马路上人来车往，华灯照耀，有些流光溢彩。	It was around eight o'clock. People and cars passed back and forth under the bright city lights.
这时，夜空是一个黑色的巨大球面，大小正好把世界扣在其中，球面上镶着无数的星星，晶莹地发着银光，每个都不比床边旧木桌上的那面圆镜子大。	The night sky was a black dome that was just large enough to cover the entirety of the world. The surface of the dome was inlaid with countless stars shining with a crystalline silver light, none of which was bigger than the mirror on the old wooden table next to the bed.
在学校里少言寡语，与同事没有私交，谁也不会想到他其实弹了一手好吉它，西班牙式的，家里存有上百张爵士乐的唱片。	At school he kept to himself and never fraternized with his colleagues. Who would have guessed that he was an accomplished flamenco guitar player with a collection of more than a hundred jazz records?
那男孩略一迟疑，道：“我叫…… 叫小玄子。	After a moment's hesitation the boy replied: 'Mine's . . . People call me Misty.
过得几日，你便要他们带你到上书房去。	Then, after a few days you're to ask them to take you to the Upper Library.
在我看来，义气就是江湖好汉中那种伟大友谊。	In my opinion, brotherhood was the kind of great friendship that only existed among the outlaws of the forest.
小红道：“也犯不着气他们。	'I don't see much point in getting angry,' said Crimson.
汪淼点点头，“用我们现有的分子建筑技术，只能生产出丝状的材料，粗细大约相当于头发丝的十分之一……	Wang nodded. 'Given our current molecular construction technique, the only form we can make is a filament. The thickness is about one-hundredth the thickness of human hair....
所以我拿了那些钱到井坎镇上，买了一条双筒猎枪。	So I brought the money with me to Jingkan and bought a double-barreled shotgun for myself.
风从所有的方向吹来，穿过衣襟，爬到身上。	The wind blew from every direction, penetrating her clothes and climbing her body.
只可怜甄家在隔壁，早成了一堆瓦砾场了，只有他夫妇并几个家人的性命不曾伤了，急的士隐惟跌足长叹而已。	Poor Zhens! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt, their house, which was only next door to the temple, was soon reduced to a heap of rubble, while Shi-yin stood by helpless, groaning and stamping in despair.
一根裹脚布，长一丈余，外曾祖母用它，勒断了奶奶的脚骨，把八个脚趾，折断在脚底，真惨！	A yard in length, the cloth bindings were wound around all but the big toes until the bones cracked and the toes turned under. The pain was excruciating.
他把牙刷从嘴里掏出来，满嘴白沫地和我讲话，我觉得很讨厌，就一声不吭地走掉了。	He took the brush out of his mouth and talked to me with a mouth full of froth. I thought he was very disgusting, so I left without a word.
韦小宝笑道：“你不会说话，不会动弹，安安静静的躺在这里，最乖不过。”	He laughed. 'You can't talk and you can't move! All you can do is just lie there like a good little girl!'
这天，警卫排排长叫叶文洁到门岗去一趟。	One day, the security platoon commander asked Ye to come to the gatehouse at the entrance to the base.
说着，只见有个丫鬟端了茶来与他。	As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea.
又行了十二三里，来到一座庄院之前。	After they had been riding along this side-road for about four miles, they came to a large farmhouse or grange.
他母亲曾有一度，热衷于收集电影说明书，“文化大革命”时自觉烧掉了她的收藏，后来的电影院也再不出售说明书了。	There was a period when his mother became obsessed with collecting movie pamphlets, but during the Cultural Revolution she took it upon herself to burn her entire collection; later the movie theaters stopped putting them out.
通往阳台的一间屋里，掩着门坐了一些人在看电视里的连续剧。	A few people sat around watching a television miniseries in the first room, which led out to the balcony.
有一次，她放下书，看到大凤把纳着的鞋底放到膝上，呆呆地看着灯花。	One time, she put down her book and saw that Feng was holding the cloth shoe she was stitching over her knee and staring into the kerosene lamp without moving.
后来东天边辉煌起来，冰上、芦苇上都染上了寒冷的死血光辉。	Then the eastern sky turned bright, staining the ice and reeds the colour of mottled blood.
她说，怎么，还要研究我的结构？	She said, What? Still want to study my anatomy?
但见她眉淡睫长，嘴小鼻挺，容颜着实秀丽，自言自语：“你是郡主娘娘，心中一定瞧不起我这小太监，我也瞧不起你，大家还不是扯直？”	She had fine eyebrows, long lashes, a small mouth and a slightly aquiline nose. But Trinket was unimpressed. 'Little Countess Lah-di-dah,' he said. 'I expect you look down on a little eunuch like me. Well, I don't think much of you either, so that makes us quits.'
顾炎武道：“此诗结得甚妙！	'Your conclusion is excellent, ' said Gu.
有一日，她用作忏悔一样的口气对王琦瑶说，表哥又请她们去片厂玩，她拒绝了。	Then one day she told Wang Qiyao in a confessional tone that her cousin had invited them back to the film studio but she had already declined the offer.
我把她的衣襟完全解开了。 这样她袒露出上身，好像是故意的一样。	I unbuttoned all the buttons on her shirt so she was half naked. It looked like she had done it herself.
那僧道：“此事说来好笑。	'You will laugh when I tell you,' said the monk.
叶文洁试着在工作中麻木自己，以便忘掉过去——她竟然几乎成功了，一种奇怪的自我保护本能使她不再回忆往事，不再想起她与外星文明曾经有过的联系，日子就这样在平静中一天天过去。	Ye tried to numb herself with work so as to forget the past—and almost succeeded. A strange kind of self-protective instinct caused her to stop recalling the past, to stop thinking about the communication she had once had with another civilization. Her life passed this way, day after day, in tranquility.
迎着她脸面的轿帘上，刺绣着龙凤图案，轿帘上的红布因轿子经年赁出，已经黯然失色，正中间油渍了一大片。	The curtain, embroidered on the inside with a dragon and a phoenix, had faded after years of use, and there was a large stain in the middle.
“你知道这不可能！”	'You know that's impossible!'
王琦瑶的母亲看出严师母身份不同，有一些安慰似的，脸色和悦了一些，泡来茶，一同坐下聊天。	Mrs. Wang, sensing that Madame Yan was a cut above the others, felt favored by the visit and tried to make herself pleasant. She even brewed some tea and sat down with Madame Yan.
真了解老克腊的是上海西区的马路。 他在那儿常来常往，有树阴罩着他。	Old Colour finds true understanding in the neighborhoods on the west side of Shanghai, and he likes to wander there along the tree-lined streets.
那僧笑道：“你放心！	'Don't you worry about him!' replied the monk with a laugh.
那位大嫂就把她捆起来，先捆紧双手，再把绳子在脖子和胳膊上扣住。	The woman tied her up, starting from her hands and then running the rope over her neck and arms to make a knot.
宝玉在麝月身后，麝月对镜，二人在镜内相视而笑。	Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at herself in the mirror. Their eyes met in the glass and they both laughed.
贾蓉先咬定牙不依，只说：“明日告诉族中的人评评理。”	But Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and insisted that he would lay the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done.
那情景有一种莫测的悸动，是王琦瑶平静生活中的一个戏剧性的片刻。	There was a strange frisson attached to that scene; it was the most dramatic moment in Wang Qiyao's quiet life.
喂这些猪原来要三个妇女，现在要我一个人干。	Originally there had been three women to do the job, but now the team leader assigned it all to me.
忽然一粒砂粒钻进了她的眼睛，那么的疼，冷风又是那样的割脸，眼泪不停地流。	A grain of sand suddenly got into her eye. It was so painful and the cold wind was so cutting that her tears kept rolling down.
三闷儿爬起来，抢了一把三齿要砍我，别人劝开了。	He got up, grabbed a pitchfork, and tried to stab me, but somebody stopped him.
我犹豫了几分钟，还是把装好的东西背上了肩，还用砍刀把屋里的一切都砍坏，并且用木炭在墙上写了：“XXX（军代表名），操你妈！”	After a few minutes' hesitation, I slung the pack on my back. Then I hacked up everything in the place with a machete, found a piece of charcoal, and wrote 'xxx (the military deputy's name), fuck your mother!' on the wall.
顾炎武举起酒杯，高声吟道：	Gu Yanwu raised his wine-cup and, in ringing tones, recited the following couplet:
汽枪就是他的，而且他打瞎队长的母狗时，我就在一边看着。	When he fired at the team leader's dog, I stood right beside him watching.
好在运河上的运输并不像汪淼想象的那么繁忙，平均每天只有四十艘左右的大型船舶通过。	Luckily, traffic along the canal wasn't quite as busy as Wang had imagined. On average, only about forty large ships passed through each day.
后来她不挣扎了，对我说，混蛋，你要把我怎么办。	After a while, she no longer struggled and said, You bastard! What are you going to do with me?
窗玻璃也是黄的，有着污迹，看上去有一些花的。	The windows also turn a golden yellow, but they are scratched and stained.
然而，这城市里的真心，却唯有到流言里去找的。	Only in gossip can the true heart of this city be found.
唯一和过去不同的是手上被硝酸染得焦黄。	The only difference was that my fingers had been burned yellow by nitric acid.
韦小宝想要打手势叫她别说，却又不敢移动手臂。	When Trinket heard the old eunuch's question, he wanted to signal to Blossom not to let on that he was there, but dared not risk even moving his hand.
女婴啼哭不休。 她母亲温言相呵，女婴只是大哭。	The little girl was crying in a continuous wail which her mother's gentle words of comfort were powerless to console.
它是理不直气不壮，只能背地里窃窃喳喳的那种。	There is nothing aboveboard about it, nothing straight and narrow; it can only whisper secrets behind people's backs.
故乡的黑土本来就是出奇的肥沃，所以物产丰饶，人种优良。 民心高拔健迈，本是我故乡心态。	The black soil of my hometown, always fertile, was especially productive, and the people who tilled it were especially decent, strong-willed, and ambitious.
轿夫身上散发出汗酸味，奶奶有点痴迷地呼吸着这男人的气味，她老人家心中肯定漾起一圈圈春情波澜。	The men's bodies emitted the sour smell of sweat. Infatuated by the masculine odour, Grandma breathed in deeply – this ancestor of mine must have been nearly bursting with passion.
韦小宝不肯服输，心想你大胆偷食，我的胆子也不小于你，当即拿起一块千层糕，肆无忌惮的放入口中。	Trinket was not going to be outdone. If this young fellow could continue calmly scavenging, so could he. He popped another slice of layer cake nonchalantly into his mouth.
叶文洁彻底无语了。	Ye had no words.
凤姐道：“正是呢。	'Yes, indeed!' said Xi-feng.
谈到了当年的各种可能性，谈到了我写的交待材料，还谈到了我的小和尚。	We talked about everything we could have done back then, the confessions I wrote, and even the little Buddha of mine.
凤姐笑道：“你哄我呢!	'You must be joking!' said Xi-feng.
她说，要干就干，没什么关系。	She said, If you feel like it, just do it. I don't care.
就只一件，待下人未免太严些儿。”	There's only one thing, though. She's a bit too strict with those beneath her.'
“《三体》游戏的目的很单纯，就是为了聚集起我们这样志同道合的人。” 潘寒说。	'The goal of Three Body is very simple and pure: to gather those of us who have common ideals,' Pan said.
那天抬着我奶奶的四个轿夫中，有一个成了我的爷爷——他就是余占鳌司令。	One of the four men bearing Grandma's sedan chair that day would eventually become my granddad – it was Commander Yu Zhan'ao.
前几次的亮是那种敞亮，大放光明，无遮无挡的。	During the previous few takes the light had been marked by an unbridled brilliance.
她还说，我准会被修到半死。	Chen Qingyang said that the military deputy would definitely not go easy on me, perhaps I would be kept-in-mind half to death.
后来她又从河沟里出来，走进一个向阳的山洼，看见一间新搭的草房。	Later she emerged from the gully, walked into a valley facing the sun, and saw a thatched hut that seemed newly built.
她是下班后从杨树浦过来，调了几部车，头发蓬乱着，鞋面上全是灰，声音嘶哑。	She had come straight from work in Yangshupu and had had to transfer several times on the bus. By the time she got there, her hair was disheveled, her shoes were covered with dust, and she was quite hoarse.
刘老老忙道：“一早就往这里赶咧，那里还有吃饭的工夫咧？”	'We were on our way first thing this morning,' Grannie Liu chimed in. 'There was no time to think about eating.'
凤姐向贾环道：“你也是个没性气的东西呦!	'You're a poor-spirited creature!' Xi-feng said to him.
夕阳给叶文洁瘦弱的身躯投下长长的影子。	The setting sun cast a long shadow from Ye's slender figure.
他则说他就喜欢这个。	But he insisted that he was having a good time.
那宾馆区的灯光却因为天地楼群的大和高，显得有些寂寥，却是璀璨的寂寥，有一些透心的快乐似的。	The lights over in the hotel district look a little lonely due to the heights of the buildings around it, but theirs is a resplendent loneliness that pierces the heart with rapture.
王琦瑶住进平安里三十九号三楼。	Wang Qiyao moved into the third floor of 39 Peace Lane.
过了几天，罗小四带了几个人到医院去找我。	A couple of days later, Luo Xiaosi brought several people to the hospital to see me.
不过三年五载，各人干各人的去了，那时谁还管谁呢？”	Another four or five years from now when we've each gone our different ways it won't matter any longer what all the rest of us are doing.'
这样，王琦瑶虽然不出门，也知天下事了。	Thus, without going out of her house, Wang Qiyao learned a great deal about the neighborhood.
而像我这样儿在基层摸爬滚打了十几年的重案刑警，受到了他们最好的培养和教育。”	And someone like me, a criminal cop who has been playing cat and mouse with them for more than a decade, has received the best education and training from them.'
潘寒坐下，沉默良久才开口：“有些问题我能够回答，有些不能，但如果各位与三体世界有缘，总有一天所有的问题都能得到解答。”	After looking at each of them in turn, Pan sat down and spoke. 'Some questions I can answer. Others I cannot. But if you are meant to be with Trisolaris, all your questions will be answered someday.'
沐王府的高手再多，总敌不过大内侍卫。	However many of their ace fighters the Mu Family may have got in the city, they're not going to take on the Palace Guard.
我告诉她路，还画了一张示意图，自己进山去了。	I gave her directions and even made a map for her, and then went into the mountains alone.
他自觉得胜，心下高兴，只是小郡主不会说话，未免有些扫兴，要想去解她穴道，却又不知其法，说道：“你给人点了穴道，倘若解不开，不能吃饭，岂不饿死了？	It was agreeable to have won, but it rather took the gloss off his victory that she couldn't speak. He would have liked to open the vital points that would enable her to do so, but he didn't know how. 'Now that your vital points are closed, you can't eat,' he said. 'If they're not opened, you'll just starve to death.
汪淼说：“这个能解决，有少量片状的‘飞刃’材料，可以用作细丝在柱子上固定处的垫片。”	Wang said, 'That's easy to solve. We have some small amounts of Flying Blade material that are flat sheets. We can use them to protect the parts of the column where the filaments are attached.'
旁边伏侍的人只见他先还拿着镜子照，落下来，仍睁开眼拾在手内，末后镜子掉下来，便不动了。	To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from his grasp, he finally ceased to move.
这地方一上来就显得有些没心肺，无忧虑，是因为它没来得及积蓄起什么回忆，它的头脑里还是空白一片，还用不着使用记忆力。	When you first arrive here, the place seems to lack a heart because it is so carefree—but that is because it hasn't yet had time to build up a reservoir of recollections; its mind is blank and has not begun to feel the need to call on its memory.
只见她微笑着招手，韦小宝大喜，轻轻闪身过门。 蕊初又将门掩上了，在他耳畔低声道：“我怕你进不来，已在这里等了许久。”	She smiled at him and beckoned to him to come in. He complied happily, and when he had slipped inside, she fastened the gate after him. 'I thought I'd better wait here in case you had trouble getting in,' she said softly in his ear. 'I've been waiting ever such a long time.'
海老公摇头道：“好什么？	'Better?' said the old eunuch shaking his head.
虽然如此，还是和白天不一样。	But it felt different from the day.
他在这夜晚里嗅到了他所熟悉的气息。 灯光令他亲切，是驻进他身心里的那种。	He took in the familiar scents of the city and soaked up the evening scene.
太太听见气死过去了，这会子叫我来拿你。	When Lady Wang first heard, she was so angry that she fainted, but now she's come round again and is asking for you to be brought to her.
“低下头！” 一名男红卫兵大声命令。	'Lower your head!' one of the male Red Guards shouted.
补我一枪吧……”	Shoot me, please. . . .'
然后我把她两腿捧起来，吻她的脚心。	Then I raised her legs and started to kiss the soles of her feet.
贾瑞笑道：“别是路上有人绊住了脚，舍不得回来了罢？”	'Could it be,' Jia Rui inquired archly, 'that Someone has detained him on his way home and that he can't tear himself away?'
睡了一个小时就被冻醒。	We woke up frozen after an hour.
说完这小免崽子就往河岸上窜，想一走了之。	After saying this, the little bastard tried to leap onto the bank to escape.
汪淼现在体会到，如果新天文馆的建筑师想表达对宇宙的感觉，那他成功了——	Wang thought that if the architect had intended to express a feeling about the universe, the design was a success:
等到她追出门去，我已经走了很远，我走路很快，而且从来不回头看。	She followed out the door, but I had gone pretty far. I walked very fast, never looking back.
住在刘大爹后山上时，我用它给人看手表。	I used them to fix watches while living on Grandpa Liu's back slope.
他想着：“兄弟们一并都有父母教训，何必我多事，反生疏了。 况且我是正出，他是庶出，饶这样看待，还有人背后谈论，还禁得辖治了他？”	'We are both equally subject to our parents' control,' he would say of himself and Jia Huan. 'Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife's son and he is the concubine's? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.'
他让她们等一会儿，再带她们去别处逛，今日有一个棚在做特技呢！	He told them to wait a little while, and then he would take them to watch a special effects shoot that was going on at one of the other sets!
不带我去，立刻便扠死你。”	Take me to her, or I'll strangle you this minute.'
第二天她要回上海，她叫我送她上车站。	She was going back to Shanghai the next day. She asked me to see her off at the train station.
我倒再照照正面是什么？”	But let me see what happens when I look into the other side!'
父亲怔怔地看着爷爷。 父亲的双眼大睁，从那两粒钻石一样的瞳孔里，散射出本来属于我奶奶的那种英勇无畏、狂放不羁的响马精神，那种黑暗王国里的希望之光，照亮了我爷爷的心头。	Father stared wide-eyed and fearfully at Granddad. The glare in his diamondlike pupils embodied the heroic, unrestrained spirit of Grandma, a flicker of hope that shone and lit up Granddad's heart.
现在不着急，再聊一会。	But let's not rush. We can talk a little longer.
我当然不能承认是我的错，就痛骂勒农。	Of course, I wouldn't admit it was my fault. Instead I yelled at Le Long.
现在它是一片废墟了，人创造的，又被人摧毁。	Now the village lay in ruins; man had created it, and man had destroyed it.
陈清扬说，当时她刚好醒来，看见我那颗乱蓬蓬的头正在她肚子上，然后肚脐上轻柔的一触。	Chen Qingyang said that she had just awakened in time to see my tousled head on her belly, and then she felt a gentle touch on her navel.
另一名使者将坐骑让给了韦小宝，自己另乘一马，跟随在后。	Another of them gave up his horse to Trinket and found himself another horse on which he rode along behind.
这时间的电车，多是些家庭主妇般的女人，手里拎着布袋，身上的旗袍是有皱痕的，腿后的丝袜也没对准缝，偏了那么一点，头发或是蓬乱，或是理发店刚出来戴了一顶盔似的，脸上表情也是木着的，万事俱不关心的样子。	Most of the passengers at that time of the day were housewives with cloth bags in hand, wearing wrinkled cheongsams, the seams of their stockings running crookedly up the back of their legs. They either had messy, disheveled hair or, if they had just walked out of the beauty salon, hair that look like a helmet. Their faces were rigid, as if nothing in the world concerned them.
如果打了的话，恐怕会把他打死。	If I had, it would probably have killed him.
当看到他时，他的样子使那人双眼中的睡意一下子消失了。	But when he saw Wang's face, sleep disappeared from the staffer's eyes and was replaced by fear.
我倒听见说你辛苦了好几天。”	I hear you've been very busy these last few days.'
这一天的课，两人都没上好，心不知飞到哪里去了。	Neither of them paid attention during their classes that afternoon.
我认识那里好多人，包括赶马帮的流浪汉，山上的老景颇等等。	I knew a lot of people there, including the nomads in caravans, the old Jingpos living on the mountains, and so on.
奶奶嫁到单家，其实也是天意。 那天，我奶奶在秋千架旁与一些尖足长辫的大闺女耍笑游戏，那天是清明节，桃红柳绿，细雨霏霏，人面桃花，女儿解放。	Grandma's marriage into the Shan family was the will of heaven, implemented on a day when she and some of her playmates, with their tiny bound feet and long pigtails, were playing beside a set of swings. It was Qingming, the day set aside to attend ancestral graves; peach trees were in full red bloom, willows were green, a fine rain was falling, and the girls' faces looked like peach blossoms. It was a day of freedom for them.
胡思乱想，一夜也不曾合眼。	Torn by these violent and conflicting emotions, he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep.
要是白来逛逛呢便罢； 有什么说的，只管告诉二奶奶。’”	And she says if it's just an ordinary visit she has nothing more to add; but if they have anything particular to say, she says tell them that they can say it to you instead.'
我的母亲也是小脚，我每次看到她的脚，就心中难过，就恨不得高呼：打倒封建主义！	My mother also had bound feet, and just seeing them saddened me so much that I felt compelled to shout: 'Down with feudalism!
那男孩道：“呸，你不会摔交。 ”	'You're hopeless!' he jeered. 'You obviously don't know the first thing about wrestling!'
看官：你道此书从何而起?	GENTLE READER, What, you may ask, was the origin of this book?
对于罗小四等人来说，找到我有很大的好处，我可以证明大家在此地受到很坏的待遇，经常被打晕。	For those like Luo Xiaosi, it would have been a great advantage to find me—I could prove that the city students in the area were treated badly, often beaten senseless.
“可您想过没有，阿兹特克文明最后被西方人侵者毁灭了。” 国电公司领导说， 同时环视了一下四周，仿佛是第一眼见到这些人，“这里的思想很危险。”	'But have you thought through the fact that the Aztecs were completely destroyed by the Western invaders?' the power company executive asked. He looked around, as though seeing these people for the first time. 'Your thoughts are very dangerous.'
清晰时则辨出那是九十九支火把，由数百的人簇拥着跑过来。	When it was clear he could see it was ninety-nine torches hoisted above the heads of hundreds of people hastening towards him.
他想，自己来到东北乡“婚丧嫁娶服务公司”当雇工不到两年，附近的人不会认识。	Since he had been hiring out for the Northeast Gaomi Township Wedding and Funeral Service Company for less than two years, the people around here wouldn't recognise him.
她紧跟形势高喊口号，终于得到了一点报偿，在后来的“复课闹革命”中重新走上了讲台。	Her attempts to chase the political winds and shout the right slogans finally paid off, and later, during the 'Return to Class, Continue the Revolution' phase, she went back to teaching.
但叶文洁的学生从事的项目与这些射电望远镜没有什么关系，沙瑞山博士的实验室主要接收三颗卫星的观测数据：1989年11月升空、即将淘汰的微波背景探测卫星COBE，2003年发射的威尔金森微波各向异性探测卫星WMAP和2009年欧洲航天局发射的普朗克高精度宇宙微波背景探测卫星Planek。	But the work of Sha Ruishan, Ye's student, had nothing to do with these radio telescopes. Dr. Sha's lab was mainly responsible for receiving the data transmitted from three satellites: the Cosmic Background Explorer, COBE, launched in November of 1989 and about to be retired; the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP, launched in 2003; and Planck, the space observatory launched by the European Space Agency in 2009.
俗语说的：‘千里搭长棚——没有个不散的筵席。’	'You know what they said about the mile-wide marquee: 'Even the longest party must have an end'?
“最近才知道，她那二十多年，是在红岸基地度过的。”	'It was only recently revealed that she had spent more than twenty years at Red Coast Base.'
程先生倒反有些窘，说：随便问问的。	Mr. Cheng grew a bit self-conscious. 'I was only asking.'
掌锤的队长毫不怀疑这种手术施之于人类也能得到同等的效力，每回他都对我们呐喊：你们这些生牛蛋子，就欠砸上一锤才能老实！	Our team leader, the one who always wielded the hammer, had no doubts that surgery of this kind would also work on humans. He would shout at us all the time: You young bulls! You need a good hammering to make you behave.
下一步的作战目标十分明确，就是要夺取‘审判日’号上被截留的三体信息，这些信息，可能对人类文明的存亡具有重要意义。”	The next war objective is very clear: We must capture the intercepted Trisolaran messages stored on Judgment Day. These messages may have great significance for our survival.
贾瑞一把拉住，连叫“菩萨救我！”	Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously. 'Holy one, save me!' he cried out again and again.
陈清扬说，那回我比哪回都混蛋，是指我忽然发现她的脚很小巧好看。	When Chen Qingyang said I was a bigger bastard than ever, she meant that I suddenly noticed her feet were cute and pretty.
劫路人催逼着奶奶往高粱地里走，他的手始终按着腰里的家伙。	The highwayman began pushing her into the sorghum field, his hand never leaving the object at his belt.
二奶奶的曲线流畅；二奶奶的双乳高耸；二奶奶的崎岖不平的额头上流动着细小的沙流；二奶奶性感的双唇从金沙中凸出来，好象在召唤着一种被华丽的衣裳遮住了的奔放的实事求是精神……	Second Grandma's shapely figure; Second Grandma's high-arching breasts; tiny grains of shifting sand on Second Grandma's furrowed brow; Second Grandma's sensual lips protruding through the golden-yellow sand . . .
贾环便瞪着眼，“六！” “七！” “八！” 混叫。	'Six! Seven! Eight!' shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the die to perform the impossible.
“听到了吗？	'Did you hear that?'
停了一会儿，他突然问道：康明逊是孩子的父亲吧？	After a long silence, he suddenly asked, 'Kang Mingxun is the father, isn't he?'
但沙瑞山立刻抽走了他怀中这唯一的一根救命稻草。	But Sha then deprived him of this last glimmer of hope.
她母亲便连连冷笑道：王琦瑶原来是在坐月子，我倒不知道，她男人都没有，怎么就坐月子，你倒给我说说这个道理！	Mrs. Wang laughed coldly. 'Oh, so Wang Qiyao should be resting this month, should she? That's funny, I didn't know. With no man around to rely on, how is she supposed to be able to rest? Will you explain that to me?'
“我搞纳米材料。”	'I work in nanotech.'
沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏幕上出现一条平直的绿线，“你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是2.726±0.010K，那个误差是银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。	As he spoke, Sha typed quickly at the terminal. Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen. 'This curve is the real-time measurement of the overall cosmic microwave background—oh, calling it a straight line would be more accurate. The temperature is 2.725±0.002K. The error range is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the Milky Way, which has already been filtered out.
这一句倒是真话，他妈妈胡里胡涂，小宝到底几岁，向来说不大准。	This was true. His mother had always been vague when asked about his age.
韦小宝扑将过去，便去扭男孩的双臂。 那男孩一侧身，右手一勾，韦小宝站立不住，立时倒了。	Trinket sprang forward and seized the boy's arms, intending to give him a sharp twist, but the boy turned smartly, and hooked him with his right foot, sending Trinket crashing to the floor.
士隐慌忙起身谢道：“恕诓驾之罪，且请略坐，弟即来奉陪。”	Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and excused himself: 'I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope you will forgive me. If you don't mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall be with you directly.'
轿夫抬轿从街上走，迈的都是八字步，号称“踩街”，这一方面是为讨主家欢喜，多得些赏钱； 另一方面，是为了显示一种优雅的职业风度。	As the bearers carried their load down the path, their feet left a series of V imprints known as 'tramples' in the dirt, for which satisfied clients usually rewarded them, and which fortified the bearers' pride of profession.
好在吴佩珍是压得起的，她的人生任务不如王琦瑶来得重，有一点吃老本，也有一点不计较，本是一身轻，也是为王琦瑶分担的意思。	It was a good thing that Wu Peizhen could take it; after all, the weight of everyday living did not rest as heavily on her. This was partly because she had plenty of psychic capital to draw on, but also because she simply did not mind. Things came easy to her and she was willing to bear more than her share.
“叶哲泰！”	'Ye Zhetai!'
过了很长时间，天渐渐亮了。 雾从天顶消散。	After a long while, the sky gradually lightened and the fog began to disappear from above us.
她感到悲从中来，不可断绝。	She felt an endless flow of sorrow.
因见上面大旨不过谈情，亦只是实录其事，绝无伤时诲淫之病，方从头至尾抄写回来，闻世传奇。	He could see that its main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher.
照领导定的性，我们在后山上干的事，除了她像考拉那次之外，都不算案子。	According to the leaders, what we did on the back slope was not considered a primary offense—except the time that she looked like a koala bear.
就拿今日天气比，分明冷些，怎么你倒脱了青肷披风呢？”	Take today, for instance. It's obviously colder today than it was yesterday. Then why of all days should you choose today to leave your blue cape off?'
那是百分之百的天然橡胶。	They were made of 100 percent natural rubber.
这刘老老方安顿了，便说道：“我今日带了你侄儿，不为别的，因他爹娘连吃的没有，天气又冷，只得带了你侄儿奔了你老来。”	Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again: 'The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and Ma haven't anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder, and – and – I thought I'd bring him here to see you...'
只见她脸颊雪白，没半分血色，长长的睫毛不住颤动，想是心中十分害怕，笑道：“你不用怕，我不会杀了你的。	From the snowy pallor of her cheeks, drained of all their colour, and the fluttering of her long eyelashes, he could tell that she was very frightened. 'Don't be afraid,' he said. 'I'm not going to kill you.
但是当初调她来，分明有修理一下的意思。	But it was clear from the start the military deputy just wanted to make trouble for her.
你身上中的毒，旁人没解药，我终究是有的。 小娃娃，你到底是受了谁的指使，想这计策来弄瞎我眼睛？	Now then, no one else has an antidote for this poison but me, so why don't you be a good little boy and tell me who you are working for? Who was it that put you up to blinding me?
一家四口，以务农为业。 因狗儿白日间自作些生计，刘氏又操井臼等事，青板姊弟两个无人照管，狗儿遂将岳母刘老老接来，一处过活。	The four of them depended on agriculture for their living, and since, with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his wife busy about the farm drawing water, pounding grain, and the like, there was no one to look after Qing-er and her little brother, Gou-er invited his mother-in-law, old Grannie Liu, to come and live with them.
又见三两个妇人，都捧着大红油漆盒进这边来等候。	Then two or three women bearing large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which she sat and stood there waiting to be called.
她的好看突出了吴佩珍的丑，她的精细突出了吴佩珍的粗疏，她的慷慨突出的是吴佩珍的受恩，使吴佩珍负了债。	Her beauty highlighted Wu Peizhen's unattractive appearance; her meticulousness highlighted Wu Peizhen's lack of care; her magnanimity highlighted Wu Peizhen's indebtedness.
周瑞家的认了半日，方笑道：“刘老老，你好?	Zhou Rui's wife scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her. 'Why, it's Grannie Liu! How are you?
余司令问。	Commander Yu asked him.
说着便同士隐复过这边书院中来了。	And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door.
总舵主一言不发的听完，点头道：“原来如此。	The Helmsman listened to all that Trinket had to say without making a single interruption. When at last Trinket had finished, he nodded. 'I see.
我抬举起你来，这会子我来了，你大模厮样儿的躺在炕上，见了我也不理一理儿。	After all I've done for you – and now when I come to call on you, you lie back there on the kang like a young madam and haven't even the grace to look up and take notice of me! You and your airs and graces!
“高考？”	'The exam?'
天也晚了，不虚留你们了，到家该问好的都问个好儿罢。”	It's late now, so I won't try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered when you get back!'
他顾不上伤痛，急忙地、讨好似的回答：“有，有，有。”	Ignoring his pain, he eagerly and ingratiatingly replied, 'Yes yes yes.'
陈清扬在我的草房里时，裸臂赤腿穿一件白大褂，和她在山上那间医务室里装束一样。	As Chen Qingyang sat in my thatched shack and poured out her troubles, she had on a white smock that left her arms and legs exposed, the same outfit she had worn earlier in her clinic.
大爷说，“心急喝不得热粘粥。”	Greedy eaters never get the hot gruel.'
这种弥漫全宇宙的残留背景辐射，在厘米波段上是可以观测到的。	The radiation fills the entire universe and can be observed in the centimeter wavelength range.
“这种看法是片面的。” 叶哲泰平静地说。	'That is a very one-sided view,' Ye said calmly.
有那么多的矢车菊，在杂草中高扬着细长的茎，开着紫、蓝、粉、白四色花。	Everywhere you looked, narrow stems of cornflowers were bosomed by clumps of rank weeds, their purple, blue, pink, and white flowers waving proudly.
当船体通过一半时，汪淼甚至怀疑钢柱间的纳米丝是不是真的就不存在。	When half the ship had passed, Wang began to doubt whether the nanofilaments between the steel pillars really existed.
“不吱声？	'No answer?
表哥的步子也迈得很快，有要紧事去做似的。	The cousin also moved briskly, as if he had something urgent to take care of.
他们是老克腊读体育系时的同学，以体育的精神独领风骚，也体现了当今世界的潮流特征。	All of them were college classmates of Old Colour from the phys-ed department; they prided themselves on their athletic spirit and prowess, which happened to be right in tune with worldwide fashion.
谁学习好，谁考的分高谁就能上！	Whoever studies hard and gets the best score gets to go to college!
大江南北，见闻所及，不但读书人反对鞑子，而贩夫走卒、屠沽市井之中，也到处有热血满腔的豪杰。	And wherever I've been, north or south of the River, I've discovered that it isn't only among educated people like ourselves that resistance to the Tartars is to be found. Many of our most ardent patriots are small tradesmen, Yamen runners, or market folk—people belonging to the very lowest ranks of society.
现在，三十九号住进一个王琦瑶，不由她又惊又喜，还使她有同病相怜之感。	She was therefore delighted to see another woman similarly out of place moving into no. 39.
高粱挺拔的秆子，排成密集的栅栏，模模糊糊地隐藏在气体的背后，穿过一排又一排，排排无尽头。	Erect stalks of sorghum formed dense barriers behind a wall of vapour. Each barrier led to another, seemingly endless.
韦小宝也低声道：“我来迟啦。 我在路上绊到了一只又臭又硬的老乌龟，摔了一交。”	'I know, I'm late,' Trinket whispered back, 'but I had a fall on the way. I tripped over a horrible old turtle.'
贾蓉忙回来，满脸笑容的瞅着凤姐，听何指示。	Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with eyebrows arched inquiringly.
前面三辆囚车中分别监禁的是三个男子，都作书生打扮，一个是白发老者，两个是中年人。	In each of the first three carts a single male prisoner was caged, identifiable by his dress as a member of the scholar class. One was a white-haired old man. The other two were men of middle years.
我所能交待的事就是在地头休息时摸她的乳房。	What I could confess was that I fondled her breasts when we rested at the edge of the field.
这时候，弄底的水泥地还在晨雾里头，后弄要比前弄的雾更重一些。	At this moment the cement pavement of the longtang is still enveloped in fog, which lingers thick in the back alleys.
可是她没有。	But to my surprise, she didn't slap me.
士隐因说道：“适闻仙师所谈因果，实人世罕闻者；但弟子愚拙，不能洞悉明白。	'It is not often that one has the opportunity of listening to a discussion of the operations of karma such as the one I have just been privileged to overhear,'said Shi-yin. 'Unfortunately I am a man of very limited understanding and have not been able to derive the full benefit from your conversation.
我都听见了。”	I heard you say it.'
凤姐笑道：“亲戚们不大走动，都疏远了。	'Relations don't come to see us much nowadays,' said Xi-feng affably. 'We are getting to be quite strangers with everybody.
那时我们的事情还没完。	At the time we hadn't finished our business yet.
假如没有一个王二告诉她这条路，她不可能在茫茫荒山里找到一间草房。	If there had been no Wang Er to tell her the route, she wouldn't have been able to find such a tiny hut in the vast, wild mountains.
说毕，二人去了。	Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to himself.
他抬头看到，吼叫的人三十岁出头，面孔像刀削的一样，皮肤焦黄，下巴漫长，头戴一顶香色呢礼帽，手里持着一只乌黑的短枪。	He looked up to see a man in his thirties with a flat, chiselled face, yellow skin, and a long, jutting chin. He was wearing a chestnut-coloured wool cap and brandishing a black pistol!
找了半天，都是秃的，因说道：“前儿一枝新笔放在那里了? 怎么想不起来？”	After rummaging for several minutes she had only succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use. 'Funny!' she said. 'I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ...'
说完这话，他觉着自己也要流泪，赶紧拎起热水瓶回房间去了。	With those words he could feel the tears welling up and hastened back into the room with the hot water thermos.
严家师母每逢星期一和四，到王琦瑶这里打一种进口的防止感冒的营养针。	Every Monday and Thursday Madame Yan would come for a shot of imported vitamins to help her ward off colds.
漫山冷雾时，腰上别着刀子，足蹬高统雨靴，走到雨丝里去。	When cold mist drifted over the mountain, she would tuck a knife into her belt, put on a pair of rain boots, and enter the drizzle.
我归司务长领导，他还有监视我的任务。	I worked under the mess officer, who also had the task of watching me.
好了，从现在开始，如果那伟大的波动出现，数值会自动存盘。”	Okay, it's all set. From now on, if such great fluctuations occur, the data will be automatically saved to disk.'
怎么敦？ 正着敦反着敦？	How do you want to strengthen it, from the front or from the back?
我正在兴头上，对她这种口气只微感不快。	I was at the height of my excitement and the tone of her voice upset me a little.
过了两日，得了空儿，仍找寻凤姐。	And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time, he was back once more looking for Xi-feng.
上海弄堂里的做人，是悉心悉意，全神贯注的做人，眼睛只盯着自己，没有旁骛的。	The people in Shanghai's longtang neighborhoods conduct themselves with the utmost attention and care; all their energy is directed to the way they carry themselves. Their eyes are focused exclusively on themselves, and they are never distracted by their surroundings.
他从日本北海道的荒山僻岭中归国之后，双目深不可测，盯住什么就像要把什么烧焦似的。	He returned to China from the mountains of Hokkaido with an unfathomable depth in his eyes, gazing at things as though he could will them to combust spontaneously.
但是垂不垂黑不黑的，不是你的事。	As far as drooping or not drooping, dark or not dark, that's none of your business.'
汪淼站起身来，但上校拉住了他，“教授，你不用管，他们会干得很好。”	Wang stood up, but the colonel pulled him down. 'Professor, don't worry. They know what to do.'
兄弟和梨洲兄推想，这次‘明史’一案所以如此大张旗鼓，雷厉风行，当是鳌拜意欲挫折我江南士人之气。”	Huang and I are both of the opinion that Oboi is at the back of this Ming History affair. The reason they are making such a song and dance about it and pursuing it with such ferocity is that he sees in it a means of breaking the spirit of the Southern gentry.'
后来我活过来了，说道：换换，你看我的，我就翻到上面去。	After a while I came back to life and said: Let's switch. Here we go. So I rolled over onto her body.
我们结了账，走到街上去。	We checked out and walked in the street.
群狗一哄而散，坐得远远的，呜呜地咆哮着，贪婪地望着死尸。	The howling dogs scattered, then sat on their haunches once they were out of range, setting up a deafening chorus of angry barks as they gazed greedily, longingly at the corpses.
韦小宝道：“我跟海老公。”	'I'm with Hai Goong-goong.'
平安里的夜晚其实也是有许多想头的，只不过没有王琦瑶窗帘上的大花朵，映显不出来罢了。 许多想头都是沉在心底，沉渣一般。 全是叫生计熬炼的，挤干汁，沥干水，凝结成块，怎么样的激荡也泛不起来。	There was a great deal of thinking going on around Peace Lane, but much of it, like sediment, had sunk to the bottom of people's hearts, all the juice squeezed out of them, so that they had solidified and could no longer be stirred up.
这种弄堂的房屋看上去是鳞次栉比，挤挤挨挨，灯光是如豆的一点一点，虽然微弱，却是稠密，一锅粥似的。	Apartment structures are built virtually on top of one another, cheek by jowl, breathing down upon each other's necks. Their lights are like tiny glowing peas, not very bright, but dense as a pot of pea porridge.
薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因下月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的：这么粗，这么长，粉脆的鲜藕；这么大的西瓜；这么长，这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。	'Look,' said Xue Pan. 'I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise, only it's my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I don't know where they got them from but they've given me: a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as long as that; a huge great melon, look, as big as that; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam.
麻雀肉味鲜美，营养丰富。	They were delicious.
为此她没少发牢骚，严先生枕头上也立下千般愿，万般誓，不料公私合营，产业都归了国家，能保住一处私房就是天恩地恩，花园洋房终成泡影。	In response to her complaints, he had, in bed, promised many times to move them to a house with a garden. Now that their assets were controlled by the government, they felt lucky simply to be allowed to keep their house.
程先生笑了：我当然明白的。	Mr. Cheng laughed, 'Of course I do.'
韦小宝一鼓作气的走来，身上的疼痛倒也可以耐得，给蕊初这么一问，只觉得全身筋骨无处不痛，忍不住哼了一声。	The effort of getting to this appointment had absorbed so much of his attention that it had almost taken his mind off the pain; but as soon as she asked the question he became aware that he was hurting dreadfully all over and groaned in spite of himself.
看了心里有点欢喜，还有点起腻。 因她们站得远，听不见那里在说什么，只见有一个穿睡袍的女人躺在床上，躺了几种姿势，一回是侧身，一回是仰天，还有一回只躺了半个身子，另半个身子垂到地上的。 她的半透明的睡袍裹着身子，床已经皱了，也是有点起腻的。	Standing there watching they were quite excited, but at the same time irritated because they were too far away to hear what was being said on set. All they could see was a woman in a sheer nightgown lying on a bed with wrinkled sheets. She tried to lie in several different positions; on her side one moment, on her back the next, and for a while even in a strange position where half her body extended off the bed onto the floor. All this became somewhat boring.
它们是上海弄堂的思想，昼里夜里都在传播。	They are the thoughts of Shanghai's longtang, disseminating themselves through day and night.
“会伤及无辜吗？”	'Will innocent bystanders be hurt?'
那小孩点头道：“我明白了。	'I know,' said the boy.
其盘费余事，弟自代为处置，亦不枉兄之谬识矣。”	I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your friendship.'
但斯坦顿居然似乎听懂了，他用刚刚抽出的一根雪茄指着史强说：“这个警察有什么资格这么对我们讲话？”	But Stanton seemed to understand what he was saying. He pointed at Shi Qiang with a fresh cigar that he had just taken out. 'Who does this policeman think he is, that he can talk to us this way?'
自己又不尊重，要往下流里走，安着坏心，还只怨人家偏心呢。	You've no self-respect, that's your trouble. Can't keep away from the gutter. You insist on making yourself disagreeable and then you complain that people are prejudiced against you!
张永红掂得出那光荣的分量，她说：你真是叫人羡慕啊！	Zhang Yonghong, who understood the magnitude of the splendor Wang Qiyao was describing, exclaimed, 'I'm so envious!'
做你娘的美梦！”	You're fucking dreaming!'
啊哟，不好，这时候宫门早闭，又怎逃得出去？	Aiyo, I can't though! The gates will have been shut long ago.
概括地说，是这样的：我和军代表有私仇，这私仇有两个方面：	To summarize, it went like this: The military deputy had a personal grudge against me, which was twofold.
老乌龟不是真的教我武功，他教我的都是假功夫。”	What the Old Devil taught me wasn't real Martial Arts, it was just rubbish.'
父亲拉着爷爷，爬上河堤，笨拙地往西走去。	Father pulled him up onto the dike and began walking awkwardly towards the west.
但是我在深山里在她屁股上打了两下，彻底玷污了她的清白。	But I spanked her bottom in the midst of the mountains, which completely tarnished her innocence.
又想：“倘若这里真是皇宫，那么老吴、温家哥儿，还有那个小玄子都是太监了。	If this really is the Forbidden City, then old Wu and the Wen brothers and little Misty must all of them be eunuchs.
鳖便是甲鱼，捉你这只小甲鱼。”	'Little turtle!'
“我站在他们一边。” 汪淼指指记者和哲学家等人说。	'I stand with them,' Wang said, pointing to the reporter and the philosopher.
适才那一枪，是扛着一盘耙在头前开路的大个子哑巴不慎摔倒，背上的长枪走了火。	The offending discharge had been the result of carelessness by the big fellow they called Mute, who was up front carrying a rake on his shoulder. The rifle slung over his back had gone off when he stumbled.
陈清扬也是这么解释的，可是那女孩说，我可以把精液放到试管里，寄到云南让陈清扬人工授精。	Chen Qingyang explained things to her daughter that way, too. But the girl said I could have put my sperm in a test tube and mailed it to Chen Qingyang, who was still in Yunnan at that time, for artificial insemination.
它就像箱底的旧衣服一样，好是好，可是错过了年头，披挂上身，一看就是个陈年累月的人，所以它还是给王琦瑶添旧的。	It was like the old clothes at the bottom of her chest: though many were still in good shape, wearing them only made her look older, because they were from the wrong era.
佳蕙点头，想了一会道：“可也怨不得你。	Melilot shook her head sympathetically. 'I can't say I really blame you,' she said.
凤姐道：“碰坏一点儿，你可仔细你的皮！”	'If it's the tiniest bit chipped,' said Xi-feng, 'I'll have the hide off you!'
六个人沿着大路行不到三里，便转入右边的一条小路。	The little party of six walked their horses along the road for about a mile before taking a right-hand turn into a little side-road.
那人用一只手按着那布包。	His hand rested on it.
就在蓑衣旁边，蚯蚓在爬。	Worms wriggled next to our palm-bark rain capes.
他走到门口，便听到海老公的咳嗽之声，问道：“公公，你好些了吗？”	As he drew near the entrance, he heard the old fellow coughing. 'Goong-goong? Are you feeling any better?'
为了伟大友谊，我还能光着屁股上街跑三圈。	For the sake of our great friendship, I would even run three times around the block, bare assed.
这时，孩子见久久没人管她，便大哭起来。	At this point, the baby, whom no one had been tending to, began to howl.
“已经了结了，你应该听说过的。”	'The past is finished. You should know that.'
因此刘老老看不过，便劝道：“姑爷，你别嗔着我多嘴：咱们村庄人家儿，那一个不是老老实实，守着多大碗儿吃多大的饭呢!	Grannie Liu could eventually stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter's behalf. 'Now look here, son-in-law: probably you will think me an interfering old woman; but we country folk have to be grateful for what is in the pot and cut down our appetites to the same measure.
我们在地头休息时，陈清扬拿斗笠盖住脸，敞开衬衣的领口，马上就睡着了。	During our break at the edge of the field, Chen Qingyang covered her face with a bamboo hat, opened her shirt collar, and immediately fell asleep.
这时，王琦瑶的心才擂鼓似的跳起来。	In that instant her heart began pounding like a drum.
他像喜鹊珍爱覆巢中最后一个卵一样珍爱着我父亲，但是，已经晚一点了，命运为他安排的更残酷的结局，已在前面路口上，胸有成竹地对他冷笑着。	He loved my father as a magpie loves the last remaining egg in its nest. But by then it was too late, for fate, cold and calculating, had sentenced him to a cruel end that was waiting for him down the road.
‘谋事在人，成事在天’，咱们谋到了，靠菩萨的保佑，有些机会，也未可知。	'Man proposes, God disposes. It's up to us to think of something. We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He'll help us or not. Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for.
“你给我下来，我操死你活妈！”	'I'll fuck your living mother! Climb down from there!'
他们有两儿两女，女孩都嫁出去了，一个儿子在外地当兵，另一个成家后与他们一起过，儿媳妇也是刚生了娃。	They had two sons and two daughters. The daughters were married and had moved out. One of the sons was a soldier away from home, and the other was married and lived with them. The daughter-in-law had also just given birth.
为了伪装，两根钢柱上都挂了一些航标和水位标志。	As a disguise, the pillars were decorated with some navigational markings and water depth indicators.
海老公道：“偷什么书？”	'Which book?'
她说这是女儿做的孽。	She said the culprit was her daughter.
一时那男孩翻在上面，一时韦小宝翻在上面，翻了十七八个滚，终于两人互相扭住，呼呼喘气，突然之间，两人不约而同的哈哈大笑，都觉如此扭打十分好玩，慢慢放开了手。	They struggled for a while, each one gaining the upper hand for a moment, then going under, ringing the changes more than a dozen times, until finally they were in a complete deadlock, panting and staring fixedly at each other. And then suddenly, at exactly the same moment, they both burst out laughing. There was something about the clinch they were in that struck them both as terribly funny. Slowly they let go.
从路两边高粱地里飘来的幽淡的薄荷气息和成熟高粱苦涩微甘的气味，我父亲早已闻惯，不新不奇。	He was used to the delicate peppermint aroma and the slightly sweet yet pungent odour of ripe sorghum wafting over from the sides of the path – nothing new there.
到了这个时候我才悟到，犯不着向人证明我存在。	By then I began to realize that it was really unnecessary for me to prove my existence to others.
高粱深处，蛤蟆的叫声忧伤，蝈蝈的唧唧凄凉，狐狸的哀鸣悠怅。	From deep in the sorghum came the melancholy croaks of toads, the dreary chirps of grasshoppers, and the plaintive howls of foxes.
她订了一份晚报，黄昏时间是看报度过的，报上的每一个字她都读到，懂一半，不懂一半，半懂不懂之间，晚饭的时间便到了，炉子上的水也开了。	She subscribed to an evening newspaper to fill the hours of dusk. She read every word in the newspaper, making sense perhaps of half the reports. By the time she finished it, the water would be boiling and it would be dinner time.
陈清扬一出十五队我就看见了，白天未必能看这么远。	I spotted Chen Qingyang as soon as she came out of the fifteenth team—I doubted if I could see that far during the day.
老头子跪在地上，哀求道：“八路老爷饶命，八路老爷饶命……”	He rose to his knees and begged, 'Spare me, Eighth Route Master, spare me!'
那一条条一排排的里巷，流动着一些意料之外又清理之中的东西，东西不是什么大东西，但琐琐细细，聚沙也能成塔的。	Something is flowing through the longtang that is unpredictable yet entirely rational, small, not large, and trivial—but then even a castle can be made out of sand.
她说，女儿建议她去做整容手术。 但是她没时间做。	She said her daughter suggested that she have plastic surgery, but she couldn't find time to do it.
对我一刻也不能放松。	People shouldn't let up on me for a minute.
